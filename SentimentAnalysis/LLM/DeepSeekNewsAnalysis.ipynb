         "By Jonathan Stempel\n\n(Reuters) - Amazon.com was sued on Friday by consumers over its alleged sale of a wide variety of rice contaminated by arsenic and other \"heavy metals.\"\n\nThe proposed class action in Seattle federal court covers 18 types of rice sold through Amazon, including from familiar brands such as Ben’s Original and Amazon-owned Whole Foods’ 365.\n\n\"Amazon sold these rice products with alarmingly high levels of heavy metals to an intended consumer audience that includes children, with no warning whatsoever about the dangers of heavy metals,\" the complaint said.\n\nThe lawsuit followed a study last week by Healthy Babies, Bright Futures, a nonprofit that focuses on babies’ exposure to toxic chemicals.\n\nThat study found arsenic in all 145 rice samples purchased nationwide, with 28% exceeding a U.S. Food and Drug Administration limit for infant rice cereal.\n\nIt also found cadmium in all but one sample, and lead and mercury in more than one-third of tested samples.\n\nAmazon, based in Seattle, had no immediate comment.\n\nExposure to heavy metals has been associated with negative health effects such as nervous system problems, immune system suppression and kidney damage, and autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in young children.\n\nThe 18 rice products include two from Ben’s Original and three with the 365 label.\n\nPlaintiffs Ashley Wright and Merriman Blum said they would not have bought or would have paid less for Iberia Basmati 100% Aged Original rice, one of the products, if they knew the rice was contaminated or Amazon never tested it for heavy metals.\n\nFriday’s lawsuit seeks unspecified damages of at least $5 million for Amazon’s alleged violations of Washington state consumer protection laws.\n\nMakers of baby food and dark chocolate have also faced many consumer lawsuits over the alleged presence of heavy metals.\n\nThe case is Wright et al v Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ), U.S. District Court, Western District of Washington, No. 25-00977.",

         "(Reuters) -Oracle will spend around $40 billion on Nvidia (NASDAQ: )’s higher-performance chips to power OpenAI’s new U.S. data center, the Financial Times reported on Friday.\n\nThe data center, situated in Abilene, Texas, is part of the U.S. Stargate Project, led by top AI firms in the country, to boost America’s heft in the artificial intelligence industry amid heating global competition.\n\nThe cloud service provider will purchase around 400,000 of Nvidia’s most powerful GB200 chips and lease the computing power to OpenAI, the report said, citing several people familiar with the matter.\n\nOpenAI and Oracle (NYSE: ) did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment, while an Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nThe data center is expected to be fully operational by mid-next year, and Oracle has agreed to lease the site for 15 years, the report said.\n\nJPMorgan has provided a bulk of the debt financing across two loans totaling $9.6 billion, while the site’s owners, Crusoe and U.S. investment firm Blue Owl Capital, have invested around $5 billion in cash, the FT report added.\n\nThe data center will help OpenAI reduce its dependence on its largest backer Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) as the ChatGPT maker’s demand for power has outstripped the supply Microsoft can provide.\n\nFor Oracle, the data center and Stargate present an opportunity for the firm to boost its cloud computing capabilities and catch up to market leaders Microsoft, Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Google (NASDAQ: ).\n\nOpenAI, Oracle, and Nvidia are also involved in a Stargate project in the Middle East, where a new massive AI data center will be constructed in the United Arab Emirates, likely using over a hundred thousand Nvidia chips.\n\nThe first phase of the UAE data center will come online in 2026.",

         "By Chibuike Oguh\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. stocks fell on Friday, notching a weekly loss, after President Donald Trump recommended 50% tariffs on European goods, reopening a new front in global trade tensions and unleashing a fresh wave of market uncertainty.\n\nAll three main Wall Street indexes pared early losses but each still ended lower and shed more than 2% for the week. Technology, communication services and consumer discretionary stocks were the biggest losers of the ’s 11 subsectors. Utilities, consumer staples and energy stocks gained.\n\nApple (NASDAQ: ) touched a two-week low and finished down 3% after Trump warned the iPhone-maker it could face potential 25% tariffs on phones sold to U.S. customers but not manufactured in the country.\n\nTreasury yields eased from multi-month highs, falling 4.4 basis points to 4.509% for the benchmark U.S. 10-year note.\n\n\"If I were to put a headline on today’s story, it would be ’Here We Go Again!’\" said James St. Aubin, chief investment officer at Ocean Park Asset Management in Santa Monica, California.\n\n\"This is Trump turning on the temperature on the tariff conversation with the EU and Apple. The markets were hoping that the worst was behind us when it comes to the tariff rhetoric. But in reality, there’s still some smoldering embers when it comes to the tariff talk,\" St. Aubin added.\n\nThe fell 256.02 points, or 0.61%, to 41,603.07, the S&P 500 lost 39.19 points, or 0.67%, to 5,802.82 and the lost 188.53 points, or 1.00%, to 18,737.21.\n\nFor the week, the Dow lost 2.47%, the S&P 500 fell 2.61%, and the Nasdaq shed 2.48%.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Trump did not believe the EU’s trade offers were of sufficient quality. He also said he hoped the threat of fresh tariffs would \"light a fire under the EU\" in negotiations.\n\nMost megacap and growth stocks fell, including Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) - which all lost more than 1%. Tesla (NASDAQ: ) ended down 0.5%.\n\nThe , Wall Street’s \"fear gauge,\" hit a more than two-week high and finished up 10%. Semiconductor stocks dropped 1.5%.\n\nDeckers Outdoor (NYSE: ) slumped nearly 20% after the maker of UGG boots forecast first-quarter net sales below estimates and said it would not provide annual targets due to tariff-led macroeconomic uncertainty. Sportswear maker Nike (NYSE: ) dropped 2.1%.\n\nVolume on U.S. exchanges was 17.67 billion shares, compared with the 17.73 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.",

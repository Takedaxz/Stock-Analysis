                  "Investing.com-- Most Asian stocks rose on Wednesday tracking a strong overnight session on Wall Street, as investors cheered President Donald Trump’s postponement of steep trade tariffs against Europe.\n\nTechnology stocks led gains for the day, buoyed by stellar earnings from China’s Xiaomi (OTC: ) (HK: ), and as investors piled into the sector before earnings from artificial intelligence major NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: ), which are due later today.\n\nGains in Asian markets came tracking a sharp overnight jump in Wall Street, as investors also cheered some signs of stability in the bond market. U.S. stock index futures were flat in regional trade, with steady around 5,934.0 points after the surged over 2%.\n\nSome regional markets also lagged, with Australian shares rising marginally after a strong consumer inflation print.\n\nChinese shares moved in a flat-to-low range as weak earnings from ecommerce giant PDD Holdings (NASDAQ: ) added to concerns over sustained deflation and weak consumer spending in the country.\n\nTech stocks advance with Nvidia earnings in focus\n\nJapan’s rose 0.6%, while South Korea’s rallied 1.8% to a nine-month high on outsized gains in technology stocks.\n\nJapan’s Advantest Corp. (TYO: )- an Nvidia supplier- rose 2.2%, while South Korea’s SK Hynix Inc (KS: ) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS: ), who both supply Nvidia with memory chips– rose 2.7% and 3.3%, respectively.\n\nTaiwan’s TSMC (TW: ) and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (TW: ) (Foxconn) rose about 0.5% each.\n\nInvestors were seen piling into tech, especially in chipmakers and AI-tangential stocks, as they positioned for a strong earnings print from Nvidia.\n\nThe AI major is set to report earnings after the U.S. close on Wednesday, and is forecast to clock strong earnings and revenue growth, as it continued to benefit from outsized spending on AI infrastructure, especially by major U.S. companies.\n\nBut focus will be on Nvidia’s outlook on AI demand and China, especially as the company grapples with stricter U.S. restrictions on chip exports to Beijing.\n\nChina shares lag, deflation concerns outweigh strong Xiaomi earnings\n\nChina’s and indexes fell marginally, while Hong Kong’s shed 0.3%.\n\nConcerns over Chinese deflation and weak consumer spending came to fore this week following weak earnings from ecommerce major PDD. The company’s first-quarter profit nearly halved as local sales suffered from heightened competition and weak spending, while its international business, specifically budget marketplace Temu, was hit by heightened uncertainty over U.S. trade tariffs.\n\nPDD’s weak print comes just a week after ecommerce major Alibaba’s earnings underwhelmed.\n\nConcerns over deflation largely offset a strong showing from Xiaomi, which clocked a record first quarter profit. Xiaomi’s shares rose 1.6% in Hong Kong trade.\n\nBroader Asian markets mostly advanced, although gains were limited in several markets. Australia’s rose 0.2%, lagging its regional peers as mildly stronger than expected raised some doubts over when the Reserve Bank of Australia will cut interest rates next.\n\nSingapore’s index rose 0.4%, while Japan’s index rose 0.5%.\n\nfor India’s index fell 0.1%, pointing to a weaker open for the index as it struggled to make headway above 25,000 points.",

                  "By Rocky Swift\n\nTOKYO (Reuters) - Asian shares continued a rally from Wall Street and the dollar held gains on Wednesday on promising economic signs in the United States and speculation of strong tech earnings.\n\nMarkets welcomed what appeared to be easing trade frictions between the U.S. and Europe while global bond markets settled down after a scary surge in long-term yields. U.S. consumer confidence surprised on the upside ahead of closely watched jobs figures on Thursday.\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: ) jumped more than 4% yesterday and will be the last of the Magnificent 7 tech giants to report earnings after markets close in the U.S.\n\n\"There is renewed confidence that Nvidia can beat the consensus estimates,\" said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone.\n\nIf Nvidia comes through with better-than-expected sales and profit margins \"the rally is on,\" he added.\n\nThe chipmaker is expected to report that first-quarter revenue surged 66.2% to $43.28 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.\n\nIn signs of a thaw between the U.S. and Europe, European Union officials have asked companies for details of their U.S. investment plans, according to two sources familiar with the matter.\n\nMSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.3% in morning trading while advanced 0.6%, climbing a fourth straight session.\n\nThe , which tracks the greenback against a basket of currencies, rose 0.1%, adding to Tuesday’s 0.6% rally. The greenback advanced 0.1% to $1.132 against the euro.\n\nAustralian shares were up 0.17%, but the nation’s currency slid 0.2% after April consumer price data came in above expectations. The dollar slid 0.3% after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand cut rates as expected.\n\nJapanese bonds slid, trimming a surge yesterday, ahead of a 40-year auction and on speculation the Ministry of Finance will reduce the issuance of long-dated securities.\n\nOil prices ticked up in early trading as the U.S. barred Chevron (NYSE: ) CVX.N from exporting crude from Venezuela under a new authorization on its assets there, raising the prospect of tighter supply.\n\nfutures rose 0.4% to $64.37 a barrel, while U.S. rallied 0.1% after dropping more than 1% on Tuesday.\n\n(Rocky Swift in Tokyo; Editing by Saad Sayeed)",

                  "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures rose slightly on Tuesday evening with focus squarely on earnings from artificial intelligence major Nvidia, with sentiment upbeat on some trade tariff deescalation and positive consumer data.\n\nFutures steadied after a stellar session on Wall Street, as investors cheered President Donald Trump’s delaying of steep trade tariffs against the European Union, while stronger-than-expected consumer confidence data pointed to resilience in the economy.\n\nTechnology stocks also courted heavy buying before Nvidia’s earnings, which are likely to act as a bellwether for the sector. Analysts expect another strong quarter from the chipmaker.\n\nrose 0.1% to 5,939.75 points, while rose 0.1% to 21,476.75 points by 19:14 ET (23:14 GMT) rose 0.1% to 42,465.0 points.\n\nNvidia Q1 earnings awaited for more AI cues; shares surge\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: ) is set to report its first-quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday, with analysts expecting a strong print.\n\nShares of the AI major surged 3.2% on Tuesday and were flat in after-hours trade.\n\nNvidia is forecast to post earnings per share of $0.893 on revenue of $43.12 billion for the three months to April 31, both up substantially from last year, Investing.com data showed.\n\nThe chipmaker is expected to have benefited from outsized domestic demand, especially as its biggest customers– Wall Street’s so-called AI hyperscalers– continued spending billions on building more data center capacity.\n\nBut focus will be on Nvidia’s outlook, which is likely to set the tone for the tech industry going forward in 2025. Investors will also be watching for comments on Nvidia’s China sales, as the company grapples with more U.S. export controls and increased competition in the country.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang recently criticized the U.S. export restrictions, calling them a \"failure,\" and also forecast China becoming a $50 billion market in the coming years.\n\nWall St rises on Trump tariff delay, strong consumer sentiment\n\nWall Street clocked strong gains on Tuesday, after Trump’s delaying of 50% tariffs against the EU boosted risk appetite. Trump’s move– which is another instance of the president flip-flopping on his tariff plans– spurred bets that he will not deliver on his agenda of imposing steep reciprocal trade tariffs in July.\n\nSentiment was also boosted by substantially stronger than expected data for May, which rebounded after five months of declines.\n\nThe rebound also comes following a deescalation in trade tensions between the U.S. and China, and as Trump’s administration attempts to reach trade deals with several major economies.\n\nThe rose 2.1% to 5,921.54 points, while the surged 2.5% to 19,199.16 points on Tuesday.

                  "Investing.com-- mining and nuclear technology stocks in Asia extended gains on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump signed executive orders aimed at reviving the U.S. nuclear industry.\n\nAustralia’s Paladin Energy Ltd (ASX: ), Boss Resources Ltd (ASX: ), Deep Yellow Ltd (ASX: ), and Nexgen (NYSE: ) Energy rose between 6.9% and 16% by the market close on Monday. China’s China National Nuclear Power Co Ltd (SS: ), China Nuclear Engineering Corp Ltd (SS: ), and CGN Power Co Ltd (HK: ) advanced between 1.5% and 6% by the midday break.\n\nTrump on late-Friday signed four nuclear energy-related orders to speed up reactor testing, allow the Departments of Energy and Defense to build nuclear reactors on federal land, overhaul the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and boost U.S. mining and enrichment of uranium.\n\nThe move presents the prospect of increased demand for uranium in the U.S., which is likely to drive up prices of the material. Demand for more reactor technology- a bulk of which is developed by China and Russia- is also expected to increase, benefiting Chinese companies in the sector.\n\nGlobal uranium demand has steadily declined since Japan’s Fukushima disaster in 2011, with Europe, the U.S., and Japan rapidly scuttling reactors and switching to alternative electricity sources on safety concerns.\n\nBut nuclear energy proponents were seen gaining traction in recent years, especially amid expectations of increased electricity requirements from the artificial intelligence industry.\n\nMajor AI spenders such as Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) were also recently seen funding nuclear energy agreements to meet rapidly growing electricity demands from AI.\n\nAustralia is the world’s fourth-largest uranium producer, while China is no.8. Kazakhstan is the world’s biggest uranium producer, according to data from the World Nuclear Association.",

                  "Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\nNvidia shares ‘attractively valued’ ahead of Q1 earnings: Stifel\n\nStifel remains positive on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: ) ahead of the company’s fiscal first-quarter earnings report, describing the stock as “attractively valued” despite ongoing headwinds from China-related restrictions and a mixed macro backdrop. Nvidia is set to report results on May 28.\n\nThe broker expects results and guidance to come in largely in line with expectations but acknowledged that recent export controls on Nvidia’s H20 AI chips in China have weighed on revenue. Still, Stifel sees strong momentum building for the second half of the year.\n\n“Our supply chain discussions continue to point to significant acceleration into 2H,” Stifel analysts wrote, highlighting Nvidia’s growing footprint in regions like the UAE and Saudi Arabia, aided by favorable U.S. policy moves. These trends are viewed as incremental positives that complement an overall resilient supply chain.\n\nThe analysts noted that investors are likely to remain focused on three key areas: ongoing demand from hyperscalers and the durability of infrastructure spending, the evolving impact of China export restrictions, and any margin pressure associated with early production ramps of the new GB200 and GB300 chips.\n\nDespite these uncertainties, Stifel sees no threat to Nvidia’s dominance in the AI space. “We do not expect any change to NVDA’s leadership positioning in shaping global AI infrastructure,” the note said.\n\nThe brokerage reiterated its bullish stance on valuation, highlighting Nvidia’s central role in the AI ecosystem. “We continue to view shares as attractively valued within the context of that positioning,” the analysts concluded.\n\nTesla is ‘most undervalued AI play,” says Wedbush\n\nMeanwhile this week, Wedbush Securities raised its 12-month price target on Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: ) to a Street-high $500 from $350, citing a major valuation opportunity tied to the company’s autonomous vehicle and AI strategy. The brokerage reiterated its Outperform rating, describing Tesla as a leader entering a \"golden age of autonomous growth.\"\n\nAnalysts Daniel Ives and Sam Brandeis highlighted the upcoming launch of Tesla’s autonomous platform in Austin as a key catalyst, calling it the start of a new era for the company.\n\nThey estimate the AI and autonomy market opportunity for Tesla to be worth at least $1 trillion, referring to the automaker as “the most undervalued AI play in the market today.” Tesla’s long-term positioning, they said, could rival other tech leaders like Nvidia, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ).\n\nWedbush expects significant value to be unlocked through Tesla’s full self-driving (FSD) technology and the rollout of its autonomous Cybercab service. The firm sees adoption of FSD exceeding 50%, which would meaningfully shift Tesla’s financial model and expand margins.\n\nAlthough Tesla faced early 2025 headwinds, including controversy over Elon Musk’s ties to the Trump administration, Wedbush said those concerns are “in the rear-view mirror” and sees a “recommitted Musk” driving the company’s AI and robotics ambitions.\n\nDespite ongoing challenges in China and Europe, the analysts believe the main narrative for Tesla now centers on the coming “AI revolution,” which could push the company’s market cap to $2 trillion by the end of 2026 in a bullish case.\n\nEvercore reiterates bullish view on Dell after annual user conference\n\nEvercore ISI reiterated its Outperform rating on Dell Technologies (NYSE: ) following the company’s annual “Dell World” conference, voicing confidence in Dell’s growing role in enterprise artificial intelligence. The broker remains bullish on Dell’s positioning as businesses ramp up adoption of generative AI solutions.\n\n“We continue to believe that DELL is well-positioned to benefit from the acceleration of enterprise Gen AI adoption,” Evercore wrote in a note recapping the event’s first day.\n\nCEO Michael Dell used the keynote to unveil a range of new offerings, including AI servers powered by Nvidia’s Blackwell and AMD (NASDAQ: ) chips, an updated lineup of AI PCs, and enhanced networking and managed AI services.\n\nA major theme was the expected shift of enterprise AI workloads back on-premise, driven by cost advantages. “DELL expects 85% of enterprises to move Gen AI workloads on-prem in the next 24 months due to better costs with on-prem inferencing compared to on public clouds,” the note said.\n\nEvercore emphasized Dell’s deep technical experience in building next-gen AI systems for cloud providers and AI model developers, now being applied to enterprise clients. This background gives the company “invaluable technical expertise that it can bring over to the enterprise level,” the analysts noted.\n\nAmong the standout announcements was the Dell Pro Max Plus, billed as “the first mobile-workstation with an enterprise-grade NPU,” designed for edge inferencing in a portable format. On the infrastructure side, new servers featuring Nvidia’s B300 and GB300 chips aim to enhance AI inference capabilities.\n\n“With today’s announcements, we think DELL can be an enterprise customer’s ‘one-stop shop’ for all its AI infrastructure needs through the lifecycle,” Evercore concluded.\n\nMongoDB downgraded on weaker-than-expected AI tailwinds\n\nLoop Capital downgraded MongoDB (NASDAQ: ) to Hold from Buy and sharply cut its price target to $190 from $350, citing concerns over the company’s cloud database platform, Atlas.\n\nThe brokerage in a Tuesday note pointed to \"lackluster market adoption\" of Atlas, suggesting the trend could persist and weigh on the company’s ability to capitalize on AI-related workloads.\n\n“While AI hype continues to grow,” Loop Capital analysts said, “MongoDB may not see a proportional benefit in the near term,” noting that the cloud database market remains “highly fragmented” and companies are unlikely to standardize on a single vendor for AI deployments. This, they warned, could result in a slower buildout of AI workloads on MongoDB’s platform relative to broader adoption trends.\n\nLoop also flagged feedback from industry contacts suggesting that the rise of generative AI is reducing development complexity, making consolidation onto a single database platform less compelling. “This could lead to organizations opting for low-cost alternatives, including open source platforms such as PostgreSQL,” the broker wrote.\n\nDespite MongoDB’s efforts to gain traction with large enterprises, Loop Capital sees limited success. “The need to consolidate and standardize on one platform within a large organization… is becoming less relevant.\"\n\nHSBC ups Bilibili to Buy on undemanding valuation, strong outlook, AI investments\n\nIn another rating change, HSBC upgraded Bilibili Inc (NASDAQ: ) to Buy from Hold, pointing out a stronger outlook across gaming, advertising, and profitability, alongside what it sees as an attractive valuation. The bank also raised its price target to $22.50 from $21.50, suggesting about 25% upside from current levels.\n\nHSBC analysts pointed to the outperformance of Sanmou Season 7 (S7), saying it “beat our/Street expectations,” and expressed optimism about the upcoming Season 8, expected to launch later this month with significant enhancements.\n\nThe bank also revised its game revenue forecasts upward by 6% to 8% for 2025 through 2027 and boosted its overall revenue projections by 2%, citing “better-than-expected VAS driven by quality user growth.”\n\nBilibili’s first-quarter results topped expectations, with non-GAAP net profit coming in 25% above HSBC’s estimate and 40% above the Street. The surprise was attributed to “lower-than-expected R&D and G&A expense.”\n\nLooking ahead, HSBC forecasts 20% revenue growth in the second quarter, led by a 61% year-over-year increase in gaming, 19% in advertising, and 10% in value-added services. The bank believes “more resilient performance in high-margin game and ad businesses can support stronger earnings prospects.”\n\nIn advertising, growth is being driven by improved ad load, rising eCPM, and expanding user traffic. HSBC expects continued gains as “ad tech improvement is expected to further enhance user targeting and conversion.”\n\nThe note also highlights Bilibili’s investment in AI, including work on fine-tuning open-source models and plans to launch a text-to-video tool for creators by the end of 2025.\n\nAt 22x estimated 2025 earnings and with non-GAAP EPS growth projected at 48% in 2026, HSBC sees the stock’s valuation as compelling.",

                  "Investing.com -- Here is your Pro Recap of the top takeaways from Wall Street analysts for the past week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\nReddit\n\nWhat happened? On Monday, Wells Fargo downgraded Reddit Inc (NYSE: ) to Equal-weight with a $115 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Reddit faces AI-driven user pressure. Growth outlook dims.\n\nWhat’s the full story? Wells Fargo anticipates Reddit’s user base faces structural challenges as Google (NASDAQ: ) integrates AI-driven search features, likely pressuring logged-out user engagement and, subsequently, ad revenue. The bank forecasts ad revenue to fall 6% and 14% below consensus in 2026 and 2027, respectively, with EBITDA trailing by 2% and 15%. Logged-out users, accounting for 55% of the total user base but just 15% of ad revenue, remain critical for scale and long-term growth. However, their engagement—20% of logged-in users’ time—is concentrated on low-ad-load comment pages, limiting monetization.\n\nWells Fargo slashes the three-year logged-in DAU growth outlook to 10% from 13%, citing reduced user acquisition potential. The bank doubts Reddit can meet ad growth expectations on logged-in users alone, as achieving Meta-like monetization appears unrealistic.\n\nReddit’s high-margin data licensing business, while lucrative, conflicts with community health and ad-based monetization, posing long-term risks. The bank warns of disintermediation as AI-powered search increasingly bypasses Reddit, delivering direct answers sourced from its data. Wells Fargo suggests Reddit prioritize internal monetization of its content and data over licensing revenue, despite forgoing ~$150M in incremental high-margin income.\n\nThe bank sees Reddit’s path to a 15% annual return—requiring a 25% revenue CAGR and 15x FY28 EBITDA multiple—as overly ambitious, given the challenges ahead.\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprises\n\nWhat happened? On Tuesday, Evercore upgraded HP Inc (NYSE: ) to Outperform with a $22 price target.\n\n*TLDR: HPE upgraded; upside to $30. Multiple catalysts drive value.\n\nWhat’s the full story? Evercore upgrades Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: ) to Outperform, citing an attractive risk/reward profile with potential upside to $30 and downside support around $15.\n\nThe brokerage highlights four key scenarios: 1) The Juniper deal closes, driving double-digit EPS growth and a $23-24 stock price; 2) No Juniper deal but HPE improves margins via cost cuts, potentially reaching $26-31; 3) The Juniper deal fails, leaving HPE rangebound at $15-16; and 4) A sum-of-the-parts analysis suggests $25-30 in value from premium multiples in networking and storage. Evercore sees multiple pathways to upside, particularly for long-term investors.\n\nThe brokerage believes HPE’s current valuation offers a compelling entry point, with catalysts including cost synergies, margin improvements, and potential value unlocking. Despite operational challenges and integration risks, Evercore views the stock as poised for meaningful upside, driven by a mix of strategic execution and activism.\n\nThe upgrade reflects confidence in HPE’s ability to navigate its near-term hurdles and deliver long-term shareholder value.\n\nUnitedHealth Group\n\nWhat happened? On Wednesday, HSBC downgraded Unitedhealth Group (NYSE: ) to Reduce with a $270 price target.\n\n*TLDR: UNH downgraded; recovery risks intensify. Earnings cuts loom.\n\nWhat’s the full story? HSBC downgrades UnitedHealth Group (UNH), emphasizing risks that disrupt its recovery narrative. The firm identifies three critical concerns: 1) Medical loss ratio (MLR) pressures in 2025, with consensus estimates exceeding prior guidance, potentially spilling into 2026; 2) Underappreciated policy risks for Optum Rx, including PBM reforms and drug pricing models; and 3) A justified lower multiple due to declining ROEs. HSBC argues these risks outweigh the allure of a 30% historical P/E discount.\n\nThe firm expects prolonged earnings cuts as new leadership resets expectations and navigates Medicare Advantage complexities for 2026-27. Balancing bids, benefits, and star ratings remains a challenge, while potential Medicaid funding cuts add further pressure. HSBC believes recovery will be delayed, and the stock’s underappreciated risks warrant caution.\n\nPlanet Fitness\n\nWhat happened? On Thursday, Stifel upgraded Planet Fitness Inc (NYSE: ) to Buy with a $120 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Planet Fitness stabilizes; growth catalysts emerge. Pricing and policy boost outlook.\n\nWhat’s the full story? Stifel sees Planet Fitness as a gym empire on the mend, with gross joins stabilizing and a handful of catalysts poised to keep comp sales growing in the mid-to-high single digits.\n\nThe analysts argue the company’s marketing has room to sharpen further, while a likely Black Card price hike could juice comps by 3-4%. Efforts to elevate the Black Card Spa’s allure add another layer of optimism.\n\nThe wildcard? The “One, Big, Beautiful Bill” in Congress could let gym memberships slide into HSA-eligible expenses, potentially turbocharging membership growth. Stifel bumps up its comp and unit growth estimates, betting on steady member growth and a pricing tailwind stretching years ahead. For now, the barbells are looking up.\n\nWaste Management\n\nWhat happened? On Friday, JPMorgan upgraded Waste Management Inc (NYSE: ) to Overweight with a $277 price target.\n\nWhat’s the full story? JPMorgan upgrades Waste Management (WM) to Overweight, setting a December 2025 price target of $277 based on 16x FY1 EV/EBITDA and a 3% free cash flow yield, roughly 1x above current levels but in line with the broader waste index. The bank notes WM’s valuation has lagged peers, which re-rated 1-5x in the past year, as skepticism persists around the Stericycle (NASDAQ: ) acquisition and renewable (RNG) project spending.\n\nHowever, JPMorgan expects WM’s valuation gap to narrow, driven by high single-digit (HSD) revenue and HSD-low double-digit (LDD) EBITDA growth targets over the next five years. Key drivers include cost and revenue synergies from Healthcare Solutions/Stericycle and accelerating sustainability initiatives.\n\nThe bank sees potential to lift Stericycle’s core growth from low single digits (LSD) to mid-single digits (MSD) through improved pricing and cross-selling, with Healthcare Solutions’ EBITDA margins reaching the mid-20% range long term. Upside optionality includes future M&A and additional EBITDA accretion from sustainability projects, particularly with favorable RVO announcements.\n\nFor investors willing to look past near-term skepticism, WM’s runway for growth appears compelling.",

                  "By Sara Merken\n\n(Reuters) - Four partners are leaving law firm Paul Weiss, after it struck a deal in March with U.S. President Donald Trump to lift an executive order that targeted the firm.\n\nKaren Dunn, Bill Isaacson, Jeannie Rhee and Jessica Phillips said in an internal email obtained by Reuters they were departing to form a new practice together.\n\n\"We were disappointed not to be able to tell each of you personally and individually the news that we have decided to leave Paul, Weiss to start a new law firm,\" the email said. \"It has been an honor to work alongside such talented lawyers and to call so many of you our friends.\"\n\nThe four did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe email did not mention Paul Weiss’ deal with Trump, in which the firm pledged $40 million in free legal work to support mutually agreed causes with the administration. Eight other law firms have since made similar deals with the White House.\n\n\"We are grateful to Bill, Jeannie, Jessica and Karen for their many contributions to the firm,\" Paul Weiss Chairman Brad Karp said in a statement on Friday.\n\nDunn, co-chair of the firm’s litigation department, is a leading Washington lawyer and prominent Democrat, having served in the Obama White House and later on the debate prep team for Trump’s 2024 election opponent Kamala Harris.\n\nShe is Google (NASDAQ: )’s lead attorney in a lawsuit by the U.S. Justice Department accusing the company of monopolizing digital advertising markets.\n\nRhee joined Paul Weiss in 2019, after serving on the prosecution team led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller that probed any connections between Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and Moscow.\n\nIsaacson, a veteran antitrust lawyer, joined Paul Weiss in 2020 from Boies Schiller Flexner along with Dunn and Phillips.\n\nFour law firms have sued the Trump administration over executive orders like the one Trump rescinded against Paul Weiss, which threatened the firms’ access to government officials and federal contracting work.\n\nA judge on Friday struck down Trump’s order against Jenner & Block, following a similar ruling this month for Perkins Coie.",

                  "By Francesco Guarascio and Phuong Nguyen\n\nHANOI (Reuters) -Vietnam’s technology ministry has ordered telecommunication service providers to block the messaging app Telegram for not cooperating in combating alleged crimes committed by its users, in a move that Telegram said was surprising.\n\nIn a document, dated May 21 and signed by the deputy head of the telecom department at the technology ministry, telecommunication companies were ordered to take measures to block Telegram and report on them to the ministry by June 2.\n\nThe ministry was acting on behalf of the country’s cybersecurity department after police reported that 68% of the 9,600 Telegram channels and groups in Vietnam violated the law, citing fraud, drug trafficking and \"cases suspected of being related to terrorism\" among the illegal activities carried out through the app, the document seen by Reuters said.\n\nThe ministry asked telecommunication service providers \"to deploy solutions and measures to prevent Telegram’s activities in Vietnam,\" the document said.\n\nAfter publication of the Reuters article, the government confirmed the measures against Telegram on its web portal.\n\n\"Telegram is surprised by those statements,\" a company representative told Reuters on Friday.\n\n\"We have responded to legal requests from Vietnam on time. This morning, we received a formal notice from the Authority of Communications regarding a standard service notification procedure required under new telecom regulations. The deadline for the response is May 27, and we are processing the request,\" the Telegram representative said.\n\nA technology ministry official said the move followed Telegram’s failure to share user data with the government when asked as part of criminal investigations.\n\nThe Vietnamese police and state news outlets have repeatedly warned people of possible crime, frauds and data breaches on Telegram channels and groups.\n\nTelegram, which competes globally with other social media apps such as Facebook (NASDAQ: )’s WhatsApp and WeChat, was still available in Vietnam on Friday.\n\nVietnam’s ruling Communist Party maintains tight media censorship and tolerates little dissent. The country has repeatedly asked companies like Facebook, Google (NASDAQ: )’s YouTube and TikTok to coordinate with authorities to stamp out content deemed \"toxic\", including offensive, false and anti-state content.\n\nTelegram is accused of not applying laws that require social media to monitor, remove and block information that violate the law, according to the document.\n\nAlso, the document said that according to information from the police, \"many groups with tens of thousands of participants were created by opposition and reactionary subjects spreading anti-government documents\".\n\nThe free-to-use platform with close to 1 billion users worldwide has been involved in controversies across the world on security and data breach concerns, including in France where its founder, Pavel Durov, was briefly detained last year.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron is set to visit Vietnam from Sunday.",

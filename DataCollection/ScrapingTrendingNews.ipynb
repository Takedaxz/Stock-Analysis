                  "sell Nvidia ahead of earnings? Here’s what our AI model says By Investing.com",
                  "Investing.com -- The moment the market has been holding its breath for is finally upon us. Today, after the market closes, AI powerhouse (NASDAQ: ) is set to report its fiscal Q126 earnings amid conflicting signals.\n\nOn the one hand, rising US export curbs due to high commercial tensions with China, as well as dwindling sales in the country, could weigh on the stock. On the other hand, however, a fairly low expectation in comparison to past quarters will likely leave the giant’s top and bottom lines within reach.\n\nAgainst the volatile backdrop, we turned to our proprietary AI model for stock picking - available exclusively for InvestingPro members for less than $10 a month - for clues on whether it might be time to buy the stock ahead of its bombastic earnings report.\n\nIn fact, those who followed our AI’s picks since its launch in 2023 notched a game-changing 226.7% gain on Nvidia stock alone in the period that spanned from November 2023 to December 2024.\n\nThe stock was then dropped from our AI’s list in December and went on to move sideways for a full quarter, shedding -1.9% since.\n\nDuring that period, our AI flagged other buys instead, which helped our users notch a massive 96.7% since launch, nearly doubling their money in less than two years and outpacing the broader by 57.96%.\n\nSome of these other picks that rallied while Nvidia stalled are:\n\nMicrochip Technology (NASDAQ: ): 27.62%\n\nWalt Disney Company (NYSE: ): 23.73%\n\nMKS Instruments (NASDAQ: ): 22.79%\n\nAxcelis Technologies (NASDAQ: ): 21.50%\n\nJust to name a few...\n\nGlobal investors also got their fair share of gains during the period, with names such as:\n\nThyssenkrupp (OTC: ) (Germany): 149.7%\n\nIndra Sistemas (BME: ) SA (OTC: ): 112.18%\n\nIveco (BIT: ) (Italy): 96.47%\n\nNow, with Nvidia earnings set for release tonight, our AI’s answer to whether this is the right time to buy the stock is not yet, for Nvidia is not part of our latest list of stock picks for May.\n\nDoes this mean that the stock will not do well in its earnings?\n\nWell, not necesarily. What it really implies is that, according to a compilation of more than 150 investment-grade models, our AI found 15 other better bets for the month based on their fundamentals and chose them instead, signaling a better risk-return proposition for these stocks.\n\nSubscribe here to see the full list of stocks now for less than $10 through this link.\n\n*Already a Pro member? Then, jump straight to the picks here.\n\nWith the list for June on its way in just a few days, a good report on the fundamental side could also turn our AI model’s favor to the stock again.\n\nPro members get these picks first, with notifications on the first trading day of each month.\n\nBut how does our AI model actually work?\n\nAt the start of each month, our AI refreshes each strategy with up to 20 stock picks. These selections are based on a blend of more than 150 well-established financial models.\n\nSome stocks are added, others stay on, and a few are dropped, reflecting how the AI evaluates their medium-term growth potential.\n\nPerformance is then tracked using equal weighting across all the stocks in the strategy. You don’t have to mirror that weighting exactly, but it gives a clear picture of how effective the model is at identifying opportunity across the board.\n\nAt the end of the day, stock picking is still a game of probabilities. But the key isn’t just finding winners—it’s knowing when to move on from the ones that no longer stack up.\n\nSince launch, the model has done just that—delivering more than a few standout success stories along the way.\n\nIn fact, our backtests suggest that investors who follow the strategies over the long run will get even better results. See below:\n\nSource: ProPicks\n\nThis means a $100K principal in our strategy would have turned into an eye-popping $2,168,000 by now.\n\nAnd with the next monthly update for June right around the corner, now would be the perfect time to subscribe to InvestingPro and give yourself the upper hand before it’s too late.",

                  "Investing.com-- Shares of Nvidia’s Asian suppliers rose on Wednesday, as investors positioned for strong first-quarter earnings from the artificial intelligence major, which also acts as a bellwether for the tech industry.\n\nChipmakers and chip-adjacent stocks were the top gainers, with South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS: ) and SK Hynix Inc (KS: )- who supply Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) with memory chips- up 3.2% and 2.8%, respectively.\n\nJapanese semiconductor testing equipment maker Advantest Corp. (TYO: ) added 1.4%, while Taiwan’s TSMC (TW: ) (NYSE: ) rose 0.5%. Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (TW: ) (Foxconn), which assembles Nvidia’s chipsets, moved in a flat-to-low range.\n\nGains in Nvidia’s suppliers tracked an over 3% jump in the firm’s shares on Tuesday, as it and broader tech stocks courted increased bids on improving risk appetite.\n\nNvidia is forecast to log earnings per share of $0.893 on revenue of $43.12 billion for the three months to April 31, both up substantially from last year, Investing.com data showed.\n\nThe company is expected to have benefited greatly from sustained demand as Wall Street’s so-called AI hyperscalers continued to pour billions into data centers and cloud infrastructure.\n\nFocus will be squarely on Nvidia’s outlook, especially as the company grapples with stricter U.S. controls on sales to China. A shift towards AI inference from training, which is less data intensive, as well as increased interest in less demanding AI models, also stand to dampen future chip demand.\n\nNvidia’s shares have tended to underperform after the company’s earnings over the past three quarters, with its revenue or outlook usually missing some lofty expectations. This underperformance has also spilled over into shares of Nvidia’s suppliers in the past, with markets usually volatile in the run-up and aftermath of Nvidia’s earnings.\n\nBroader Asian tech stocks advanced on Wednesday, tracking overnight gains in their U.S. peers as markets awaited Nvidia’s earnings. Easing U.S. Treasury yields, after a sharp run-up in recent weeks, also aided tech.",

                  "Investing.com-- Most Asian stocks rose on Wednesday tracking a strong overnight session on Wall Street, as investors cheered President Donald Trump’s postponement of steep trade tariffs against Europe.\n\nTechnology stocks led gains for the day, buoyed by stellar earnings from China’s Xiaomi (OTC: ) (HK: ), and as investors piled into the sector before earnings from artificial intelligence major NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: ), which are due later today.\n\nGains in Asian markets came tracking a sharp overnight jump in Wall Street, as investors also cheered some signs of stability in the bond market. U.S. stock index futures were flat in regional trade, with steady around 5,934.0 points after the surged over 2%.\n\nSome regional markets also lagged, with Australian shares rising marginally after a strong consumer inflation print.\n\nChinese shares moved in a flat-to-low range as weak earnings from ecommerce giant PDD Holdings (NASDAQ: ) added to concerns over sustained deflation and weak consumer spending in the country.\n\nTech stocks advance with Nvidia earnings in focus\n\nJapan’s rose 0.6%, while South Korea’s rallied 1.8% to a nine-month high on outsized gains in technology stocks.\n\nJapan’s Advantest Corp. (TYO: )- an Nvidia supplier- rose 2.2%, while South Korea’s SK Hynix Inc (KS: ) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS: ), who both supply Nvidia with memory chips– rose 2.7% and 3.3%, respectively.\n\nTaiwan’s TSMC (TW: ) and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (TW: ) (Foxconn) rose about 0.5% each.\n\nInvestors were seen piling into tech, especially in chipmakers and AI-tangential stocks, as they positioned for a strong earnings print from Nvidia.\n\nThe AI major is set to report earnings after the U.S. close on Wednesday, and is forecast to clock strong earnings and revenue growth, as it continued to benefit from outsized spending on AI infrastructure, especially by major U.S. companies.\n\nBut focus will be on Nvidia’s outlook on AI demand and China, especially as the company grapples with stricter U.S. restrictions on chip exports to Beijing.\n\nChina shares lag, deflation concerns outweigh strong Xiaomi earnings\n\nChina’s and indexes fell marginally, while Hong Kong’s shed 0.3%.\n\nConcerns over Chinese deflation and weak consumer spending came to fore this week following weak earnings from ecommerce major PDD. The company’s first-quarter profit nearly halved as local sales suffered from heightened competition and weak spending, while its international business, specifically budget marketplace Temu, was hit by heightened uncertainty over U.S. trade tariffs.\n\nPDD’s weak print comes just a week after ecommerce major Alibaba’s earnings underwhelmed.\n\nConcerns over deflation largely offset a strong showing from Xiaomi, which clocked a record first quarter profit. Xiaomi’s shares rose 1.6% in Hong Kong trade.\n\nBroader Asian markets mostly advanced, although gains were limited in several markets. Australia’s rose 0.2%, lagging its regional peers as mildly stronger than expected raised some doubts over when the Reserve Bank of Australia will cut interest rates next.\n\nSingapore’s index rose 0.4%, while Japan’s index rose 0.5%.\n\nfor India’s index fell 0.1%, pointing to a weaker open for the index as it struggled to make headway above 25,000 points.",

                  "Investing.com-- U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that it would cost Canada $61 billion to be part of his proposed “Golden Dome” missile defense system, but that it would be free if the country became the 51st U.S. state.\n\n“I told Canada, which very much wants to be part of our fabulous Golden Dome System, that it will cost $61 Billion Dollars if they remain a separate, but unequal, Nation, but will cost ZERO DOLLARS if they become our cherished 51st State,” Trump said in a post on Truth.social, claiming that Canada was “considering the offer.”\n\nTrump’s comment comes after Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney last week expressed some interest in investing in the Golden Dome project, which is slated to cost about $175 billion.\n\nTrump’s comments on Canada’s sovereignty are the latest in the president’s claims that Canada could become the 51st U.S. state- a claim that has been categorically rejected by Canada.\n\nA spokesperson for Carney reiterated the country’s sovereignty, according to a comment carried by the Financial Times.\n\nCanada and the U.S. already have a defense agreement– the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), which includes measures to detect ballistic missile attacks.\n\nTrump’s proposed Golden Dome system plans to establish interceptors in space to protect the U.S. against advanced threats such as intercontinental ballistic missiles, hypersonic missiles, and long-range cruise missiles.\n\nTrump has vowed to complete the project by the end of his term.",

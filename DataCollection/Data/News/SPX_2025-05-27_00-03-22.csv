SPX,2025-05-26,06:25,Is this a turning point for markets? By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- Despite a turbulent start to 2025 marked by policy uncertainty and renewed concern over the U.S. growth outlook, equity markets have shown surprising resilience in recent weeks.

The is down just 1.3% year-to-date, while the is down about 3%. In contrast, the more economically sensitive has dropped 8.5%, reflecting investor caution toward cyclical exposure.

Wolfe Research analysts attribute the market’s recent relative stability to “positive news on the trade front and better-than-expected soft data economic surprises,” which have helped offset deepening fears of a recession that surfaced only weeks ago.

However, concerns are mounting around the U.S. fiscal trajectory. As bond vigilantes push back against unsustainable federal deficits, Wolfe expects volatility to persist through the summer.

“We continue to remain defensively positioned as stocks are likely to be hypersensitive to economic data and moves in long-term interest rates over the coming months,” the analysts wrote.

There is some early optimism, as sentiment indicators have improved slightly. Still, the analysts remains cautious.

“While we’re encouraged by the slight improvement in sentiment surveys, our sense is we’ll need to see a reacceleration in the economy before shifting to more cyclical positioning,” they said in a note.

Markets were also buoyed after Donald Trump postponed a planned 50% tariff on EU imports until July 9, following a call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

“She said she wants to get down to serious negotiation,” Trump said Sunday. “July 9 would be the day… I agreed to do that.”

In response to these news, index rose 1% while the German added as much as 1.6%.

SPX,2025-05-26,02:31,Take Five: Chips and trouble in bond land By Reuters,"(Reuters) -Chip behemoth Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) is closing the U.S. earnings season, as investors digest the appearance of the bond vigilantes in the usually rather sedate corner of long-term government debt.

Central banks in Australia, New Zealand and South Korea hold rate meetings as inflation data from around the globe provides evidence of the economic fallout from the tectonic shifts in U.S. trade policy.

Here’s your look at the week ahead from Dhara Ranasinghe, Samuel Indyk and Sinead Cruise in London, Lewis Krauskopf in New York and Kevin Buckland in Tokyo.

1/ ENDING ON A CHIP Results from Nvidia - a behemoth in the artificial intelligence field that has become a sparring ground in global trade and geopolitics - are due on Wednesday and round out the Q1 U.S. reporting season.

Nvidia is part of the ""Magnificent Seven"" megacaps, whose shares have rebounded sharply since early April after a rough start to the year.

Its AI chips have helped catapult the company to become one of the world’s largest by market value and given it heft in world equity indexes. But after two years of massive gains, the stock’s performance has levelled off so far in 2025. Nvidia’s report could test the stock market rebound, with the approaching record highs after teetering on the brink of a bear market last month.

2/ HOME TO ROOST

It’s no surprise that government debt levels have surged given relentless pressure to raise spending on everything from defence to healthcare, aging populations and climate change.

But the consequences of governments not doing enough to improve their finances are coming home to roost.

Just days after the U.S. lost its top-notch triple-A credit rating with Moody’s, a $16 billion sale of 20-year U.S. Treasuries saw soft demand and Japan had its worst auction result since 2012 - sending 30-year government bond yields to record highs.

A corner of the bond market not known for its volatility - long-dated government bonds - has suddenly become a hot spot. In addition to surging Japan government bond yields, 30-year U.S. yields are back above 5%, dragging others higher.

Japan sells more long-dated debt in the days to come. Watch those auctions. The bond vigilantes are back.

3/ HANKERING TO HIKE

Unbowed by aggressive and unpredictable U.S. tariffs - or even the recent melt-up in bond yields - the Bank of Japan has kept a very calm demeanour in saying it plans to keep raising interest rates if prices gain in line with forecasts.

A surge in rice prices has driven upward momentum. The bellwether Tokyo consumer price index is due on May 30, front-running the nationwide reading by three weeks. Figures a month ago scaled a two-year high.

Australia’s inflation data on Wednesday will be watched after the central bank cut rates in May and signalled an openness to additional easing, with cooling prices giving policy makers room to do so.

New Zealand’s central bank is seen trimming the cash rate by another quarter point the same day. On Thursday, the Bank of Korea looks ready to cut amid concerns about growing economic headwinds.

4/ PRESSURE GAUGE

Inflation is returning to the top of policy makers’ agenda elsewhere too.

The Fed’s targeted inflation metric, Personal Consumption Expenditures, for April, due on May 30, could paint a clearer picture of the impact U.S. tariffs are having.

April was a volatile month after U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff onslaught on April 2, but recent consumer and producer prices data have not flashed inflationary warning signs just yet.

Price pressures were clearly playing on the Fed’s collective minds when it kept rates steady this month, with a warning that the risk of higher inflation had increased, dampening expectations for near-term rate cuts.

The euro zone’s biggest economies - France and Germany - report consumer prices data on Tuesday and Friday, bloc-wide figures follow the week after.

5/ MEGA MAY

With fears for the U.S.’s massive debt pile quashing a relief rally in its assets, investors are planning how they might defend portfolios from more wild swings in the world’s largest economy. Top money managers at JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are laying on more hedges to diffuse some of the hits to U.S. Treasuries and stocks. Others are using the dog days of May to sell down with greater conviction, diversifying exposures by pumping more money into Europe. European equity exchange-traded funds have pulled in 34 billion euros ($38.6 billion) of cash over the year to May 16 - four times the 8.2 billion euros put in U.S. equity funds, Morningstar data shows. By comparison, in 2024, net flows into U.S. equity funds in Europe had dominated by a ratio of more than 8:1 over locally-focused products.

SPX,2025-05-25,22:40,Asia stocks mixed amid Trump tariff uncertainty; Japan extends gains By Investing.com,"Investing.com-- Most Asian markets were a mixed bag on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened and then backtracked on increased European trade tariffs over the weekend, while Japanese shares extended a run of recent gains.

But regional technology stocks, especially those supplying to Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ), fell after Trump also threatened to impose a 25% tariff on all iPhone and other smartphone imports.

Broader Asian markets tracked weakness in Wall Street on Friday after Trump threatened to impose 50% tariffs against Europe. But he then agreed to postpone the tariffs to early-July on Sunday.

US stock index futures rose sharply in Asian trade on Trump’s tariff postponement, with surging 0.9%. U.S. markets will be closed on Monday.

Japanese stocks extend gains; Nippon Steel leads on Trump support

Japan’s and indexes were the outperformers in Asian trade on Monday, rising 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively. Both indexes extended gains into a third consecutive session, amid signs of continued trade dialogue between Tokyo and Washington.

Reports said Japanese ministers will arrive in Washington in early-June for a fourth round of trade talks, although Japan has shown little signs of shifting from its position that the U.S. remove all tariffs on the country.

Nippon Steel Corp (TYO: ) was the top performer on the Nikkei, rising nearly 4% after Trump on Friday expressed some support for the company’s long-delayed, $14.9 billion buyout of U.S. Steel (NYSE: ).

Trump was referring to a “partnership” between the two companies, leaving it unclear whether the deal will proceed as a full takeover.

But Trump’s comments marked a reversal from his prior opposition to Nippon Steel investing in the U.S. steel industry, which he has viewed as a national security interest.

Apple suppliers fall on Trump tariff threat

Shares of Asian firms who supply Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) fell after Trump threatened to impose a 25% tariff on all imported iPhones, which he has repeatedly demanded be manufactured in the United States.

A bulk of Apple’s suppliers are based in China, with audio equipment supplier AAC Technologies (OTC: ) Holdings Inc (HK: ) down 2% in Hong Kong trade, while mainland-listed Luxshare Precision Industry Co Ltd (SZ: ) and Goertek Inc (SZ: ) lost more than 1% each.

Smartphone giant Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS: ), which Trump also threatened to slap with tariffs, fell 0.3%, lagging a 1% increase in the broader South Korean benchmark. Memory chip giant SK Hynix Inc (KS: ) lost 0.2%, while Taiwan’s TSMC (TW: ) shed 0.2%.

Broader Asian stocks were a mixed bag. Hong Kong’s index fell 0.2%, with electric vehicle major BYD Co (HK: ) among the biggest drags on the index, as it slid over 5% amid heavy profit-taking from a rally to record highs last week.

The mainland and indexes fell 0.1% and rose 0.3%, respectively. Focus was also on more potential trade dialogue between Beijing and Washington, after the two sides agreed to a deescalation earlier in May.

Australia’s fell 0.1%, while Singapore’s index fell 0.1%.

rose 0.4% in morning trade, pointing to a positive open for the index.

Nvidia Q1 earnings on tap, AI demand, China, in focus

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: ) is set to report its fiscal first-quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday, with focus squarely on whether the AI-fuelled demand boost it received over the past two years remained in play.

The company had recently flagged some headwinds for its China sales, especially after the Trump administration introduced even tighter curbs on chip sales to the country.

But outsized AI demand through the first quarter is expected to have boosted Nvidia’s earnings despite difficulties in China, especially as its biggest customers– Wall Street’s so-called AI hyperscalers– continued spending vast amounts of money on the technology this year.

Reuters reported over the weekend that Nvidia planned to sell a cheaper, lower-spec AI chip from its Blackwell line in China later this year.

SPX,2025-05-25,19:57,"Trump says he is not happy with Putin over Ukraine strikes, mulls new sanctions By Investing.com","Investing.com-- U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday he was “absolutely” considering new sanctions against Russia following a deadly wave of missile and drone strikes across Ukraine that killed at least 12 people.

Speaking to reporters in Morristown, New Jersey, Trump voiced growing frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling the attacks — the largest aerial bombardment of the war to date — unacceptable.

“I’m not happy with Putin,” Trump said. “He’s killing a lot of people, and I don’t know what the hell happened to him.”

The remarks represent a notable shift in tone for Trump, who has previously been reluctant to criticize the Kremlin. He said he had spoken to Putin for more than two hours last week to secure a ceasefire.

SPX,2025-05-25,08:59,"Nvidia earnings in focus as rising US yields, debt rattle markets By Reuters","By Lewis Krauskopf

NEW YORK (Reuters) -An earnings report from semiconductor giant and artificial intelligence bellwether Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) takes center stage for Wall Street in the coming week, as stocks hit a speed bump of worries over federal deficits driving up Treasury yields.

U.S. equities pulled back this week after a torrid rally, as investors turned their attention to tax and spending legislation poised to swell the U.S. government’s $36 trillion in debt. Long-dated U.S. Treasury yields rose amid the fiscal worries, with the 30-year yield topping 5% and hitting its highest level since late 2023.

Stocks were dealt another blow on Friday when U.S. President Donald Trump targeted the European Union and Apple (NASDAQ: ) in threats to ratchet up his trade war.

Focus will shift to Wednesday’s quarterly results from Nvidia, one of the world’s largest companies by market value whose stock is a major influence on benchmark equity indexes.

""All eyes are going to be on Nvidia’s report,"" said Chuck Carlson, CEO of Horizon Investment Services. ""The whole AI theme has been a major driver of the market and Nvidia is at the epicenter of that theme.""

Nvidia will be the last of the ""Magnificent Seven"" megacap tech and growth companies to report results for this period. Their stocks have been mixed in 2025 after leading the market higher as a group in the last two years.

Nvidia shares are down 2% this year after soaring over 1,000% from late 2022 through the end of 2024 as its AI chip business spurred massive increases in revenue and profits.

Nvidia’s first-quarter earnings likely jumped about 45% on revenue of $43.2 billion, analysts estimated in an LSEG poll.

After big tech companies earlier in the quarter signaled robust AI-related spending, Nvidia can deliver a strong message about AI and how companies’ spending plans are faring, said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth.

""Nvidia can reinvigorate the enthusiasm for that theme.""

Nvidia, popular among smaller retail shareholders, is an investor sentiment indicator, said Wasif Latif, chief investment officer at Sarmaya Partners.

""Given its sheer size and attention that it is commanding, there are going to be a lot of people looking for what happens with the stock,"" Latif said.

U.S.-China relations could also be in focus with Nvidia’s report. The company said last month it would take $5.5 billion in charges after the U.S. government limited exports of its H20 artificial intelligence chip to China.

Trade developments have whipsawed the stock market this year, especially after Trump’s April 2 announcement of sweeping tariffs on imports globally set off extreme asset price volatility.

Since then, Trump’s easing of tariffs, especially a U.S.-China truce, has helped equities rebound. The benchmark ended on Friday down 1.3% for 2025, and down 5.6% from its February record high.

Stocks slipped on Friday after Trump pushed for a 50% tariff on European Union goods starting June 1 and threatened to impose a 25% tariff on Apple for any iPhones sold, but not made, in the United States.

Trump’s fiscal plans consumed investor attention for much of the week, especially after Moody’s downgraded the U.S. sovereign credit rating due to concerns about the nation’s growing debt pile.

The U.S. House of Representatives, controlled by Trump’s Republican party, on Thursday narrowly passed a tax and spending bill that would enact much of his agenda while adding an estimated $3.8 trillion to the debt over the next decade. The bill is heading to the U.S. Senate for its review.

Long-dated government bond yields have been rising globally amid a selloff, although they pulled back toward the end of the week. In the U.S., benchmark 10-year Treasury yields this week hit their highest since February. Bond prices move opposite to yields.

Higher yields can diminish the appeal of stocks as they represent higher borrowing costs for companies and consumers, while making fixed income assets relatively more attractive.

""The biggest concern from an investment standpoint is that higher rates represent more competition for equities,"" said Horizon’s Carlson. ""If rates continue to move higher, that is going to put increasing amounts of pressure on where investors are putting their money.""",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/nvidia-earnings-in-focus-as-rising-us-yields-debt-rattle-markets-4063190
SPX,2025-05-25,07:00,Is a U.S. government debt crisis imminent? By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- Concerns about a potential debt crisis in the United States escalated after Moody’s downgraded U.S. government debt, and Japanese bond yields surged, sending a ripple through global markets.

The dropped 1.61%, largely driven by a poorly received 20-year Treasury auction.

Moreover, yields at the long end of the U.S. Treasury curve are rising. The 30-year bond yield surpassed 5.00% for the first time since October 2023, setting off alarm bells in the financial press.

While the remains below last year’s peak, the pressure is mounting, market research firm Yardeni Research cautions.

Part of the anxiety stems from the fiscal impact of President Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill.” The national debt has climbed to a record $36.2 trillion, with $28.6 trillion in marketable securities held by the public.

The Congressional Budget Office pegs the bill’s potential cost at $2.3 trillion over the next decade, while the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget warns it could reach $5.7 trillion if temporary tax cuts are extended.

This fiscal expansion, combined with existing tariffs, may fuel inflation, though weaker energy prices are expected to temper it. The Cleveland Fed’s Inflation Nowcasting model sees May’s headline CPI rising just 0.12% month-over-month, with core inflation at 0.23%.

Market watchers are questioning whether bond investors — the so-called Bond Vigilantes — will force the 10-year yield well above 5.00%. Such a move could signal deeper trouble.

“So is a U.S. government debt crisis imminent?” Yardeni Research asked in a recent note. “It’s possible, especially since tariffs already implemented by Trump are likely to boost inflation in coming months.”

However, there are levers policymakers can pull. The Treasury could shift more issuance toward short-term bills, a strategy dubbed “Yield Curve Control by the Treasury (YCC-T).” If necessary, the Federal Reserve could step in with renewed Quantitative Easing to stabilize markets.

A debt crisis, if it comes, may not spell disaster. As Yardeni notes, “A debt crisis need not be a calamity if it forces Washington to put U.S. fiscal policy on a credible sustainable course.”

For investors, it could even mark a long-term buying opportunity to buy stocks, the firm added.

“Fasten your seat belts,” Yardeni concluded.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/is-a-us-government-debt-crisis-imminent-4059905

SPX,2025-05-23,16:35,Trading Day: Trump shatters tariff calm with new salvo By Reuters,"By Jamie McGeever

ORLANDO, Florida (Reuters) - - TRADING DAY

Making sense of the forces driving global markets

By Jamie McGeever, Markets Columnist

Just when a degree of calm appeared to have settled over world markets, despite a worrying spike in many countries’ long-term bond yields, U.S. President Donald Trump gave the world a stark reminder on Friday that his trade war is far from over.

In threatening 50% tariffs on European goods effective June 1 and floating a 25% charge on Apple iPhones sold in the U.S., Trump shook investors from any complacency the recent de-escalation may have cultivated.

European and U.S. stocks slumped - the sealed its steepest weekly fall since March - ensuring it will be a nervy and anxious long weekend for investors. U.S. and UK markets are closed on Monday for holidays.

The optimistic view is this is a familiar negotiation tactic - come out all guns blazing, create chaos, secure concessions, retreat, then claim victory since whatever deal is struck is nowhere near as bad as the original worst-case scenario.

Analysts at Citi are confident tariff fears are contained, and that a 50% levy on Europe won’t last long even if it is implemented. The downside for risky assets is ""manageable"".

This may be the path U.S.-Europe talks follow, as appears to be the case with the U.S.-China negotiations. But large doses of uncertainty and risk have been injected back into markets, and investors must price assets accordingly.

Barclays economists estimate that if 50% tariffs on EU goods are realized, the overall trade-weighted tariff rate on all U.S. imports would rise to 21% from 14%, and an extra 0.5 percentage point hit to GDP growth would put the U.S. economy on the brink of recession.

The other main focus for investors this week was sovereign bonds, specifically longer maturities, in many G7 countries including the U.S., Japan and Britain.

Weak auctions, debt and deficit worries, and policy paralysis fears pushed long-dated yields to multi-year or record highs. Moody’s stripping the U.S. of its triple-A credit rating a week ago also weighed on the price of Treasuries.

Worryingly, rising U.S. Treasury yields offered no support to the dollar and finally started to weigh on Wall Street. Indeed, the slump in U.S. stocks immediately after Wednesday’s 20-year note auction was the third-worst market reaction to a bond auction ever, according to Kevin Gordon at Charles Schwab (NYSE: ).

The U.S. and UK holiday on Monday and month-end flows were always likely to distort markets next week. A re-escalation of global trade tensions and historically high bond yields are now in the mix too.

Chart of the Week

The dollar’s slide is remarkable. I wrote this week that while there are many valid long-term reasons to be bearish on the dollar - fiscal woes, policy credibility, end of ’U.S. exceptionalism’, de-dollarization, to name a few - the pace of selling was unsustainable and a short-term reversal appeared likely.

The dollar’s lurch lower on Friday following Trump’s latest tariff salvos puts any correction on ice. But it’s still on the cards, if the breakdown in the dollar’s correlation with yield spreads is any guide.

The dollar’s link to U.S.-euro zone yield spreads is usually very tight - when the dollar’s yield advantage widens, the currency rises; when it shrinks, the dollar weakens. But that correlation collapsed completely round about ... Liberation Day. The link is broken, but history suggests it won’t be for long.

SPX,2025-05-23,09:36,JBS minority shareholders approve dual US-Brazil listing By Reuters,"By Luciana Magalhaes and Ana Mano

SAO PAULO (Reuters) -Brazilian meatpacker JBS on Friday secured shareholder support for a long-planned dual listing in the United States and Brazil, boosting its shares as analysts calculated a higher valuation in line with global peers.

Minority shareholders at a Friday assembly in Sao Paulo delivered enough votes to approve the dual listing, according to a securities filing. On Thursday, the company said a preliminary count showed about 52% of remote votes were against the plan, raising doubts about its chances.

Guilherme Cavalcanti, JBS’s chief financial officer, told reporters the voting process on Friday was swift and a small group of lawyers cast votes on behalf of investors with significant shareholdings.

JBS shares rose 2% on the news, capping a 37% rally since mid-March as the proposal cleared several hurdles. It later pared gains and fell 1.4% at 41.67 reais.

Plans for a U.S. listing had been delayed repeatedly over the past decade, hindered by corruption scandals involving the company’s top shareholders, brothers Joesley and Wesley Batista, as well as concerns about its environmental impacts and the transparency of its climate targets.

Since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the New York listing in late April, environmental groups and U.S. politicians have aired concerns.

Analysts and proxy advisory firms had debated the merits of the company’s dual listing proposal.

Some advisory firms warned that a new dual-class share structure was likely to reduce the voting power of minority shareholders, but analysts touted the chance to bring its valuation in line with international peers.

Igor Guedes, an analyst at Genial Investimentos, said the dual listing would bring JBS stock valuation closer to peers such as Tyson Foods (NYSE: ), a major U.S. rival.

He forecast JBS’s enterprise value could rise to 7.5 times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), compared to 5.8x currently, implying a potential appreciation of 29.3% for its shares.

With the plan approved, JBS shares are expected to have their last trading day in São Paulo on June 6, according to the company’s CFO. The shares will be primarily listed in New York while Brazilian Depositary Receipts (BDR) will be traded on the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange.

The company previously said JBS could debut on the NYSE on June 12.

JBS also intends to pursue inclusion in major international indexes, such as the and Russell, according to Cavalcanti. He also said the recent sale of shares by BNDESPar, the investment arm of Brazil’s national development bank, may facilitate this process as it tends to increase the company’s free-float.

Under the proposed structure, a Netherlands-based company will issue Class A shares, which will be publicly traded, and Class B shares, which will have 10 times as much voting power and will not be traded.

XP (NASDAQ: ) analyst Leonardo Alencar said the final size of the free float still hinges on the number of shareholders converting Class A into Class B shares, a process that will last through 2026, as proposed by JBS.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/jbs-minority-shareholders-approve-dual-usbrazil-listing-4062054
SPX,2025-05-23,06:02,"Nvidia earnings in focus as rising US yields, debt rattle markets By Reuters","By Lewis Krauskopf

NEW YORK (Reuters) - An earnings report from semiconductor giant and artificial intelligence bellwether Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) takes center stage for Wall Street in the coming week, as stocks hit a speed bump of worries over federal deficits driving up Treasury yields.

U.S. equities pulled back this week after a torrid rally, as investors turned their attention to tax and spending legislation poised to swell the U.S. government’s $36 trillion in debt. Long-dated U.S. Treasury yields rose amid the fiscal worries, with the 30-year yield topping 5% and hitting its highest level since late 2023.

Stocks were dealt another blow on Friday when U.S. President Donald Trump targeted the European Union and Apple (NASDAQ: ) in threats to ratchet up his trade war.

Focus will shift to Wednesday’s quarterly results from Nvidia, one of the world’s largest companies by market value whose stock is a major influence on benchmark equity indexes.

""All eyes are going to be on Nvidia’s report,"" said Chuck Carlson, CEO of Horizon Investment Services. ""The whole AI theme has been a major driver of the market and Nvidia is at the epicenter of that theme.""

Nvidia will be the last of the ""Magnificent Seven"" megacap tech and growth companies to report results for this period. Their stocks have been mixed in 2025 after leading the market higher as a group in the last two years.

Nvidia shares are down 2% this year after soaring over 1,000% from late 2022 through the end of 2024 as its AI chip business spurred massive increases in revenue and profits.

Nvidia’s first-quarter earnings likely jumped about 45% on revenue of $43.2 billion, analysts estimated in an LSEG poll.

After big tech companies earlier in the quarter signaled robust AI-related spending, Nvidia can deliver a strong message about AI and how companies’ spending plans are faring, said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth.

""Nvidia can reinvigorate the enthusiasm for that theme.""

Nvidia, popular among smaller retail shareholders, is an investor sentiment indicator, said Wasif Latif, chief investment officer at Sarmaya Partners.

""Given its sheer size and attention that it is commanding, there are going to be a lot of people looking for what happens with the stock,"" Latif said.

U.S.-China relations could also be in focus with Nvidia’s report. The company said last month it would take $5.5 billion in charges after the U.S. government limited exports of its H20 artificial intelligence chip to China.

Trade developments have whipsawed the stock market this year, especially after Trump’s April 2 announcement of sweeping tariffs on imports globally set off extreme asset price volatility.

Since then, Trump’s easing of tariffs, especially a U.S.-China truce, has helped equities rebound. The benchmark ended on Friday down 1.3% for 2025, and down 5.6% from its February record high.

Stocks slipped on Friday after Trump pushed for a 50% tariff on European Union goods starting June 1 and threatened to impose a 25% tariff on Apple for any iPhones sold, but not made, in the United States.

Trump’s fiscal plans consumed investor attention for much of the week, especially after Moody’s downgraded the U.S. sovereign credit rating due to concerns about the nation’s growing debt pile.

The U.S. House of Representatives, controlled by Trump’s Republican party, on Thursday narrowly passed a tax and spending bill that would enact much of his agenda while adding an estimated $3.8 trillion to the debt over the next decade. The bill is heading to the U.S. Senate for its review.

Long-dated government bond yields have been rising globally amid a selloff, although they pulled back toward the end of the week. In the U.S., benchmark 10-year Treasury yields this week hit their highest since February. Bond prices move opposite to yields.

Higher yields can diminish the appeal of stocks as they represent higher borrowing costs for companies and consumers, while making fixed income assets relatively more attractive.

""The biggest concern from an investment standpoint is that higher rates represent more competition for equities,"" said Horizon’s Carlson. ""If rates continue to move higher, that is going to put increasing amounts of pressure on where investors are putting their money.""",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/nvidia-earnings-in-focus-as-rising-us-yields-debt-rattle-markets-4061611

Treasury yields eased from multi-month highs, falling 4.4 basis points to 4.509% for the benchmark U.S. 10-year note.

""If I were to put a headline on today’s story, it would be ’Here We Go Again!’"" said James St. Aubin, chief investment officer at Ocean Park Asset Management in Santa Monica, California.

""This is Trump turning on the temperature on the tariff conversation with the EU and Apple. The markets were hoping that the worst was behind us when it comes to the tariff rhetoric. But in reality, there’s still some smoldering embers when it comes to the tariff talk,"" St. Aubin added.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Trump did not believe the EU’s trade offers were of sufficient quality. He also said he hoped the threat of fresh tariffs would ""light a fire under the EU"" in negotiations.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Major stock indexes and the dollar eased on Friday after U.S. President Donald Trump unleashed his latest trade threats, recommending 50% tariffs on European Union imports from June 1 and considering a 25% tariff on any Apple (NASDAQ: ) iPhones made outside the U.S.

Shares of Apple ended 3% lower, while the three major U.S. stock indexes finished weaker but off session lows. European shares also ended lower.

The , which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, hit a three-week trough. For the week, the dollar was down 1.9%, on track for its biggest weekly percentage decline since early April.

The dollar sank 1% versus the Japanese yen, while the euro rose 0.8% against the dollar.

Government bonds in the United States and Europe climbed on safe-haven buying after sustaining heavy pressure this week from rising concerns about Trump’s tax cuts and the White House’s ballooning debt pile.

Trump said in a post on his Truth Social network: ""The European Union, which was formed for the primary purpose of taking advantage of the United States on TRADE, has been very difficult to deal with.""

This was the latest event in a jittery week for global markets after Moody’s downgraded the U.S. credit rating late last Friday and the U.S. House of Representatives narrowly approved Trump’s sweeping tax cuts on Thursday. The new tax-cut bill is expected to add almost $4 trillion to the U.S. federal government’s $36 trillion debt pile.

""Tariffs are back at the forefront,"" said Oliver Pursche, senior vice president and advisor for Wealthspire Advisors in Westport, Connecticut.

""I think the 25% tariffs on iPhones and Apple was a little bit of a surprise. It seemed like there was going to be an exemption there, and the market is reacting more to that than the EU news, and is interpreting that as a hardening of the stance by President Trump and the administration as opposed to seeking a negotiating path.""

All three major U.S. stock indexes had fallen more than 1% early in the day.

For the week, the Dow lost 2.47%, the S&P 500 fell 2.61%, and the Nasdaq shed 2.48%.

MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe fell 2.86 points, or 0.33%, to 868.15. The pan-European index fell 0.93%.

The White House paused most of the punishing tariffs Trump announced in early April against nearly every country. He left in place a 10% baseline tax on most imports, and later reduced his massive 145% tax on Chinese goods to 30%.

""Markets go through a cycle with tariffs - freak out and sell when they are announced ..., freak out and buy (when) they are paused,"" said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group in Richmond, Virginia.

The 30-year U.S. bond yield , which on Thursday hit the highest since October 2023, fell in response to fresh tariff fears.

The yield was down 2.2 basis points at 5.042%. The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes fell 3.6 basis points to 4.517%.

At 4:00 p.m. ET (20:00 GMT), the fell 256 points, or 0.6%, the index dropped 0.7%, and the slipped 1%.

Trump reignites trade worries

President Trump said on Friday that he is recommending a straight 50% tariff on goods from the European Union starting on June 1, saying the EU has been hard to deal with on trade.

""The European Union, which was formed for the primary purpose of taking advantage of the United States on TRADE, has been very difficult to deal with,"" Trump said on Truth Social social media site. ""Our discussions with them are going nowhere!""

The Trump administration had imposed 25% tariffs on EU cars, steel and aluminium in March and 20% tariffs on other EU goods in April. It then halved the 20% rate until July 8, setting a 90-day window for talks to reach a more comprehensive tariff deal.

In response, the 27-nation EU suspended its own plans to impose retaliatory tariffs on some U.S. goods and proposed zero duties for all industrial goods on both sides.

Additionally, Trump posted on Truth Social that iPhones sold in the U.S. must be made in the country and if they are not “a tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple.” The move against Apple by Trump would be the first against a specific company in his tariff rollout this year.

Apple stock fell sharply as a result.

Tax bill clears House

Investors had remained on edge over stretched U.S. debt levels, especially after Moody’s last week cut its U.S. sovereign rating over debt concerns.

Treasury yields have shot up this week as investors dumped government bonds, while an auction of 20-year bills also saw weak demand.

The House of Representatives voted to narrowly approve a sweeping tax cut and spending bill backed by Trump on Thursday, sparking more uncertainty over U.S. debt. The Congressional Budget Office, a non-partisan analytics agency, said that the bill in its current form will add about $3.8 trillion to the federal government’s $36.2 trillion debt pile over the next decade.

The legislature now heads to the Senate for more discussions and an eventual vote.

Path to rate cuts late this year - Waller

Concerns about the country’s fiscal health have added to economic worries given the uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration’s trade policies.

Federal Reserve Governor said on Thursday he still sees a path to interest rate cuts later this year.

""If we can get the tariffs down close to the 10% and then that’s all sealed, done and delivered somewhere by July, then we’re in good shape for the second half of the year, and then we’re in a good position to kind of move with rate cuts through the second half of the year,"" Waller said.

Markets did take some relief from a Supreme Court ruling that the Federal Reserve was unique, dismissing the possibility of Trump firing Chair Jerome Powell, who the president has repeatedly badgered to cut interest rates.

Tesla outsold by BYD (SZ: ) in Europe

In the corporate sector, Tesla (NASDAQ: ) was in the spotlight, after a report indicated that Chinese electric vehicle rival BYD outsold its U.S. rival for the first time in Europe.

A report from analytics firm JATO Dynamics said BYD registered 7,231 battery-powered vehicles in Europe in April, overtaking the 7,165 units registered by Tesla.

BYD’s sales also came despite the European Union imposing steep import tariffs on Chinese EVs last year.

Elsewhere, Ross Stores (NASDAQ: ) stock slumped after the discount retailer issued weaker-than-expected guidance for the second quarter, citing concerns over tariffs and macroeconomic uncertainty.

Deckers Outdoor Corporation (NYSE: ) stock traded sharply lower after the maker of UGG boots said it would not provide annual targets owing to tariff-led macroeconomic uncertainty and forecast first-quarter net sales below estimates.

On the flip side, Intuit (NASDAQ: ) stock surged after the software group raised its full-year guidance and issued an upbeat current-quarter outlook as a strong tax season spurred demand for its TurboTax and QuickBooks software.

SPX,2025-05-21,10:03,Trump aims to use tariffs to boost manufacturing jobs. But is it possible? By Investing.com,"Investing.com - U.S. President Donald Trump has laid out a wide range of objectives for his aggressive tariff agenda.

In one sense, he has argued that raising tariffs on friends and foes alike represents a push to rebalance historic perceived trade imbalances, with the levies serving as a sort of cudgle in negotiations with foreign countries.

In another, the duties are touted as a revenue-generation tactic that will help offset planned deep tax reductions.

Still one more rationale pertains to stemming the flow of the illegal drug fentanyl into the United States.

But perhaps the most sweeping goal of the duties revolves around reshoring manufacturing jobs lost overseas, with White House senior advisor Peter Navarro saying the goal to ""fill up all the half-empty factories that now are operating at low capacities around Detroit and the greater Midwest area"".

Although manufacturing was once associated with lifting scores of Americans into the middle class in the wake of the Second World War, the sector’s workforce has waned in recent decades, analysts at Wells Fargo noted. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the amount of Americans employed in manufacturing has dipped from around a quarter in the 1970s to currently roughly 8%.

Reversing this trend in the near term will likely prove to be difficult, especially as higher costs and uncertainty around Trump’s policies threaten to dent the willingness of companies to expand payrolls, the Wells Fargo analysts argued in a note to clients.

""As downstream industries face higher costs, they must decide whether to absorb them and accept lower margins, pass them onto customers via higher selling prices or a combination of the two. Neither avenue is supportive of employment growth,"" the brokerage said.

Even if Trump’s current tariff drive remains in place, a total rebound in manufacturing employment looks ""hard-pressed"", the analysts said, flagging that the capital-intensive nature of the industry in the U.S. would suggest a minimum of approximately $3 trillion of new investment.

An aging population in the U.S. and tighter immigration rules could also pose challenges for the broader labor market, including manufacturing, while factory jobs have become less desireable in the modern services-heavy U.S. economy, they argued.

""As such, a meaningful increase in the share of factory jobs, while possible, would likely unfold over many years and come at high cost,"" the analysts said.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/trump-aims-to-use-tariffs-to-boost-manufacturing-jobs-but-is-it-possible-4057101

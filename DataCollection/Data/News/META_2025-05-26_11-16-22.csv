META,2025-05-24,06:11,El Chapo’s former lawyer and an ex-drug smuggler on the ballot to be judges in Mexico By Reuters,"By Cassandra Garrison

CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico (Reuters) -When residents in the state of Durango vote in Mexico’s first judicial elections next weekend, Leopoldo Chavez will be on the ballot for federal judge - despite the nearly six years he served in a U.S. prison.

Chavez was convicted on drug offenses: for smuggling over 4 kilograms of methamphetamines in 2015. Durango is part of Mexico’s Golden Triangle, a cartel-controlled region growing marijuana and opium poppies.

""I’ve never sold myself as the perfect candidate,"" Chavez said in a video he shared on Facebook (NASDAQ: ). He said he had nothing to hide and had served his time. He declined to comment to Reuters.

In the nearby Pacific coast state of Jalisco, Francisco Hernandez is running to be a criminal magistrate even though the last time he served as a judge he was dismissed by the Federal Judiciary Council after an investigation into allegations of sexual abuse and corruption.

He told Reuters the accusations were ""slander and defamation."" ""Let the people judge me,"" he said.

And in Nuevo Leon, Fernando Escamilla is hoping to become a federal criminal judge and says the legal work he did advising lawyers for members of the ultra-violent Los Zetas cartel should not be held against him. His knowledge of extradition law, on which he advised the capos, made him an asset, he told Reuters in an interview.

""Does being an advisor on international or extradition law give you a bad public reputation? I don’t think so, since that’s the only thing that demonstrates that you have the ability and knowledge to handle these types of situations,"" Escamilla said.

Ahead of the elections on June 1, civil organizations, judge associations and some Mexican lawmakers are raising serious concerns about a vote that critics warn could jeopardize the country’s rule of law.

The controversial judicial overhaul was proposed by leftist former President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and supported by his protege, President Claudia Sheinbaum. Both said it would root out corruption in Mexico’s flawed judiciary and allow the people to decide who should be a judge.

Around 5,000 candidates are vying for more than 840 federal positions, including all Supreme Court justices.

But with the vote just over a week away, Mexican rights group Defensorxs says it has identified about 20 people vying for positions that have criminal indiscretions, corruption allegations against them or past links to cartels, including a defense lawyer who represented drug kingpin Joaquin ’El Chapo’ Guzman.

An analysis by the Judicial Electoral Observatory (OEJ), made up of non-profit organizations, has also flagged more than 130 candidates with a high probability of winning in the absence of opposing candidates, and criticized problems in the design of complicated ballots that feature hundreds of names and may confuse voters.

The reform, passed in September 2024, was criticized by then U.S. ambassador Ken Salazar, who served during the administration of President Joe Biden, as a threat to Mexican democracy.

Critics say the reform, one of the most broad-ranging to be attempted in recent years by any country in the Western Hemisphere, risks removing checks and balances on the ruling Morena party and allowing organized crime groups greater influence over the judicial system.

The reform reduces the number of Supreme Court judges to nine from 11, cuts the length of their terms to 12 years, abolishes a minimum age requirement of 35, and halves necessary legal practice to five years. It also scraps some benefits for judicial workers and creates a five-person disciplinary tribunal, which critics argue is insufficient to oversee a 50,000-member judiciary.

Defensorxs president Miguel Meza said that the candidates his organization had flagged revealed grave flaws in the government vetting system, which was meant to verify eligibility criteria including: Mexican citizenship by birth, a bachelor’s degree in law, ""good reputation,"" and a record clean of serious crime.

Meza said his organization has been making its way through the list of candidates and had identified other problematic names that they had yet to publish.

Meza said aspiring judges were apparently not screened for foreign convictions or who they had legally represented. He put much of the problem down to rushing the election.

""Everything we’re seeing is the result of trying to fast-track this reform,"" Meza said.

Sheinbaum’s office and Mexico’s federal judiciary did not respond to a request for comment on the reform or the vetting.

Both the ruling coalition and the electoral authority have tried to distance themselves from questions about eligibility, saying it is too late to do anything before the election. Victorious candidates proven to be ineligible will have to be removed after the vote, election authorities said.

A Mexican association of magistrates and judges, JUFED, said the list of controversial candidates confirms its view that the reform is a threat to judicial independence in Mexico.

""What’s happening with the election is dangerous,"" said JUFED national director Juana Fuentes. ""There is a serious risk that criminal interests or groups, or people representing them, could become involved.""

Most of Mexico’s sitting Supreme Court justices announced they would not participate in the elections and instead will resign.

Candidates cannot use campaign materials that link them to a political party, participate in events organized by political parties or accept donations of any kind.

PROFESSIONAL DUTY

Perhaps the candidate who has garnered the most headlines is Silvia Delgado, who represented the notorious El Chapo, former chief of the Sinaloa Cartel, in 2016. She visited him weekly in prison to share updates before he was extradited to the United States and eventually sentenced to life in prison.

Now, she hopes to become a criminal court judge in Chihuahua.

On a recent afternoon in the border town of Ciudad Juarez, Delgado braved the sweltering heat to hand out flyers and chat to voters outside a local school.

A single mom, who raised four children and put herself through law school, Delgado strikes a charismatic figure, in a black skirt suit and chunky heels.

""I’m not corrupt,"" she said, ""they can’t burn you for having represented someone.""

""The best legacy I can give, as a human being and for my children and grandchildren, is to have been a person of integrity, who always defended people.""

She said she considers her work representing El Chapo, which included filing a petition that he be provided a blanket in prison, to be in line with her professional duties.

Delgado is upfront about the reason she took on the job. It was, she says, a big step up for her as a lawyer; and one she’d take again. ""I was interested because it was a career opportunity... Working on the case of such a famous figure.""

She said she had not had any contact with El Chapo’s lawyers since the case, though she did agree to help his wife, a U.S.-Mexican dual national, take her children to the United States.

She kept her harshest words for activist Meza, describing him as ""irresponsible"" and running a ""Robin Hood group"" bent on ""directly attacking me.""

Meza said Defensorxs was not interested in ""attacking"" any candidate, but exposing the risks associated with them.

""Our goal is to inform the public about these risks so they can take them into account when exercising their right to vote.""

""It seems clear to us that this risk exists in Silvia Delgado’s case,"" he added. He did not identify other concerns apart from her legal work for El Chapo.

MEDIA WAR

Senate leader Gerardo Fernandez Norona, a powerful member of the ruling party, told Reuters the focus on the eligibility of certain candidates was a ""racist, classist"" media war aimed at discrediting the elections.

""It’s not important. It’s not relevant,"" Norona said, adding that people found ineligible could be withdrawn after the vote.

The INE electoral authority has made it clear that names cannot be removed ahead of the vote.

Claudia Zavala, an electoral advisor at INE, said the body should have been included earlier in the vetting process, which was conducted by committee members selected by Congress, the judicial power and the executive branch of government.

""It seems that splitting that function around other authorities was not ideal,"" she said.

Now, all that can be done by INE is a post-election review of any formal complaints about candidates in order to prove a person is ineligible to hold office, Zavala said. If a winner does not meet the requirements, the role would go to the second-placed finisher.

However, any investigation into a candidate’s eligibility must be completed by June 15, Zavala said, when election results are finalized and positions confirmed.

""The evidence must be very clear,"" she said.",https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/el-chapos-former-lawyer-and-an-exdrug-smuggler-on-the-ballot-to-be-judges-in-mexico-4062746
META,2025-05-23,19:08,Telegram ’surprised’ as Vietnam orders messaging app to be blocked By Reuters,"By Francesco Guarascio and Phuong Nguyen

HANOI (Reuters) -Vietnam’s technology ministry has ordered telecommunication service providers to block the messaging app Telegram for not cooperating in combating alleged crimes committed by its users, in a move that Telegram said was surprising.

In a document, dated May 21 and signed by the deputy head of the telecom department at the technology ministry, telecommunication companies were ordered to take measures to block Telegram and report on them to the ministry by June 2.

The ministry was acting on behalf of the country’s cybersecurity department after police reported that 68% of the 9,600 Telegram channels and groups in Vietnam violated the law, citing fraud, drug trafficking and ""cases suspected of being related to terrorism"" among the illegal activities carried out through the app, the document seen by Reuters said.

The ministry asked telecommunication service providers ""to deploy solutions and measures to prevent Telegram’s activities in Vietnam,"" the document said.

After publication of the Reuters article, the government confirmed the measures against Telegram on its web portal.

""Telegram is surprised by those statements,"" a company representative told Reuters on Friday.

""We have responded to legal requests from Vietnam on time. This morning, we received a formal notice from the Authority of Communications regarding a standard service notification procedure required under new telecom regulations. The deadline for the response is May 27, and we are processing the request,"" the Telegram representative said.

A technology ministry official said the move followed Telegram’s failure to share user data with the government when asked as part of criminal investigations.

The Vietnamese police and state news outlets have repeatedly warned people of possible crime, frauds and data breaches on Telegram channels and groups.

Telegram, which competes globally with other social media apps such as Facebook (NASDAQ: )’s WhatsApp and WeChat, was still available in Vietnam on Friday.

Vietnam’s ruling Communist Party maintains tight media censorship and tolerates little dissent. The country has repeatedly asked companies like Facebook, Google (NASDAQ: )’s YouTube and TikTok to coordinate with authorities to stamp out content deemed ""toxic"", including offensive, false and anti-state content.

Telegram is accused of not applying laws that require social media to monitor, remove and block information that violate the law, according to the document.

Also, the document said that according to information from the police, ""many groups with tens of thousands of participants were created by opposition and reactionary subjects spreading anti-government documents"".

The free-to-use platform with close to 1 billion users worldwide has been involved in controversies across the world on security and data breach concerns, including in France where its founder, Pavel Durov, was briefly detained last year.

META,2025-05-23,07:08,Voters in Suriname to choose government to helm predicted oil boom By Reuters,"By Ank Kuipers

PARAMARIBO, Suriname (Reuters) -Voters in Suriname, which is on the cusp of a predicted oil boom, will go to the polls on Sunday to elect a new parliament, which will later choose the South American country’s next president.

The contest, marked by fraud allegations, has seen little debate about what the next government, which will hold power until 2030, should do with income from the offshore oil and gas Gran Morgu project, set to begin production in 2028.

The project, led by TotalEnergies (EPA: ), is Suriname’s first major offshore effort. The former Dutch colony, independent since 1975, discovered reserves that may allow it to compete with neighbor Guyana - whose economy grew 43.6% last year - as a prominent producer.

The party with the most seats will lead Suriname’s next government, likely through a coalition with smaller parties, but negotiations and the choosing of a new president are expected to take weeks.

Potential presidential nominees from the ruling Progressive Reform Party (VHP) include President Chan Santokhi and Defense Minister Krishna Mathoera. The National Democratic Party (NDP) - founded by former President Desi Bouterse, who died a fugitive last year - could back party head Jennifer Simons, former Vice President Ashwin Adhin or Bouterse’s widow, Ingrid Bouterse.

Just under 400,000 voters, from the country’s coast to its jungle hinterlands, are eligible to elect 51 national lawmakers and 784 regional representatives. Voter turnout historically hovers around 75%.

Santokhi, who led a 1,700-person bike ride in Paramaribo on Sunday after handing out orange bicycles emblazoned with ""Chan"" on the frame, has not ruled out cooperation with any party.

""We cannot say: Cooperate with those, don’t cooperate with those,"" the 66-year-old Santokhi, a former police commissioner, said on television on Wednesday. ""Because ultimately the people decide what those parties are going to get in votes.""

COMING OIL REVENUE

Opposition NDP party leader Simons, 71, has told Dutch media she believes the government is preparing a ""massive fraud"" and that polling showing a potential VHP lead is part of the plot.

Simons, a doctor who served as speaker of parliament for a decade until 2020, has said NDP polling shows the party will win more than double the votes of the VHP, whose leaders have scoffed at the fraud allegations.

A poll commissioned by the Times of Suriname showed 39.4% support for the NDP and 21.5% for the VHP, while a poll by LC Media showed the VHP three seats ahead, with 17 seats.

Bouterse and the NDP dominated Surinamese politics for decades. He left office in 2020, the same year he was convicted in the 1982 murders of 15 government critics.

When the conviction was upheld in 2023, Bouterse went into hiding, dying at 79 at an unknown location on Christmas Eve.

His widow, Ingrid, 64, is on NDP’s parliamentary list and active in campaigning, regularly polling her Facebook (NASDAQ: ) followers on whether she should serve in parliament or be president.

Parties have made general promises to improve health, education and diversify the economy, but civil society coalition the Citizens’ Initiative for Participation and Good Governance (BINI) said in a Wednesday report they have failed to offer specifics about oil revenue spending.

""None of the parties has a clear and concrete plan for the revenues from the Gran Morgu project,"" BINI said, though it said promises may not matter much when it comes to coalition negotiations.

""It is mainly about dividing the cake - who gets which positions or ministries - not about what is best for the country,"" BINI said.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/voters-in-suriname-to-choose-government-to-helm-predicted-oil-boom-4061759

NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. stocks fell on Friday, notching a weekly loss, after President Donald Trump recommended 50% tariffs on European goods, reopening a new front in global trade tensions and unleashing a fresh wave of market uncertainty.

All three main Wall Street indexes pared early losses but each still ended lower and shed more than 2% for the week. Technology, communication services and consumer discretionary stocks were the biggest losers of the ’s 11 subsectors. Utilities, consumer staples and energy stocks gained.

Treasury yields eased from multi-month highs, falling 4.4 basis points to 4.509% for the benchmark U.S. 10-year note.

""If I were to put a headline on today’s story, it would be ’Here We Go Again!’"" said James St. Aubin, chief investment officer at Ocean Park Asset Management in Santa Monica, California.

""This is Trump turning on the temperature on the tariff conversation with the EU and Apple. The markets were hoping that the worst was behind us when it comes to the tariff rhetoric. But in reality, there’s still some smoldering embers when it comes to the tariff talk,"" St. Aubin added.

For the week, the Dow lost 2.47%, the S&P 500 fell 2.61%, and the Nasdaq shed 2.48%.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Trump did not believe the EU’s trade offers were of sufficient quality. He also said he hoped the threat of fresh tariffs would ""light a fire under the EU"" in negotiations.

Most megacap and growth stocks fell, including Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) - which all lost more than 1%. Tesla (NASDAQ: ) ended down 0.5%.

The bank also raised its year-end 2025 target for the index to 6,000, up from a previous forecast of 5,800.

The upgrade reflects a revised earnings per share (EPS) forecast for the index, now projected at $260 for 2025 and $280 for 2026, up from prior estimates of $250 and $275, respectively.

The investment bank recently downgraded its view on U.S. equities from Attractive to Neutral following a sharp rebound in stock prices and a de-escalation of trade frictions.

“With the S&P 500 forward price-to-earnings (P/E) now above 21x, it appears that investors are already pricing in a substantial de-escalation in trade frictions,” the UBS team led by David Lefkowitz said in a note.

The June 2026 price target represents a roughly 8% gain from the current level of 5,940 as of May 20. Despite a more cautious near-term outlook due to trade-related uncertainties and potential economic softening, UBS maintains that the bull market remains intact.

“We still believe the bull market is intact and stocks can continue to move higher over the coming year,” the strategists continued.

They acknowledge the headwinds posed by elevated tariffs and the possibility of renewed trade tensions, but remain constructive on the broader market. This outlook is underpinned by expectations for real wage growth, clearer tax policy, deregulation, and possible rate cuts.

Moreover, the strategists continue to see strength in key sectors. Notably, continued investment in AI is flagged as a major driver, with companies like Meta (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) voicing robust capital spending plans.

“Continued investment spending and AI adoption is an important driver for U.S. equities,” the strategists emphasized.

UBS’ base-case scenario envisions a steady macro backdrop with improving economic data later this year.

However, the report also outlines a wide range of potential outcomes, including an upside scenario where the S&P 500 could hit 6,700 by December 2025 if trade policies ease and AI delivers outsized productivity gains.

Conversely, a hard landing could push the index down to 4,500.

For now, UBS advises a balanced view. “To recap, we think the risk-reward in U.S. stocks is slightly more balanced in the near term,” the strategists concluded, while reaffirming their June 2026 target.

By sector, the bank remains selective. Information technology stands out as a top pick, driven by robust AI-related spending and supply constraints.

Communication Services are also rated Attractive, particularly among internet platforms benefiting from AI.

Furthermore, UBS sees Healthcare as well-positioned, citing attractive valuations and earnings upside potential, while Utilities are another preferred area, offering defensive traits and exposure to growing power demand from AI infrastructure.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/ubs-sets-sp-500-target-of-6400-for-june-2026-4061451

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Copyright Office director fired by the Trump administration sued President Donald Trump and other government officials on Thursday, arguing her firing was unconstitutional and should not be allowed to take effect.

Shira Perlmutter said in the lawsuit that her termination by email on May 10 was ""blatantly unlawful,"" and that only the U.S. Congress can remove her from office.

The lawsuit, filed in Washington, D.C., federal district court, is the latest in a series of legal clashes between Trump and federal officials he has sought to fire since his inauguration in January.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the complaint. A spokesperson for the Copyright Office and an attorney for Perlmutter declined to comment.

On Thursday, the Supreme Court allowed Trump’s firing of two Democratic members of federal labor boards to remain in effect while their legal challenges proceed in a dispute that tests the president’s power over independent government agencies.

The Copyright Office, a department of the Library of Congress, confirmed on May 12 that the administration had fired Perlmutter by email on May 10. Perlmutter’s firing sparked a backlash from Democratic politicians, who said that Congress had ""purposely insulated"" the Copyright Office from politics.

The lawsuit said that Perlmutter’s firing came a day after the office released a report on the high-stakes intersection of artificial intelligence and copyright law. The office said in the report that technology companies’ use of copyrighted works to train AI may not always be protected under U.S. law.

Tech companies including OpenAI and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) have told the office that being forced to pay copyright holders for their content could cripple the burgeoning U.S. AI industry.

META,2025-05-22,17:19,UBS raises S&P 500 targets; sees about 10% upside through mid-2026 By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- UBS raised its target on the from 5,800 to 6,000 and initiated a June 2026 target of 6,400. The move follows better first-quarter earnings results and expectations of higher GDP growth in the second half of 2025. The new targets represent 2.7% upside through year-end and 9.6% upside through mid-year next year.

The firm’s CIO, David Lefkowitz, made the move despite downgrading U.S. equities from Attractive to Neutral on May 12th, following the sharp bounce-back in stocks following the tariff de-escalation. Despite the downgrade, the firm is not negative on stocks and believes the bull market is intact.

“We believe the bull market is intact, and stocks will likely rise further over the next year,” Lefkowitz said. “But the economy will have to adjust to higher tariffs, and this could lead to a period of weaker economic data, which could be a modest headwind for equities.”

Stocks are far from cheap, however, the strategist notes. The S&P 500’s forward price-to-earnings ratio now stands above 21 times, surpassing its five-year median, signaling potentially stretched valuations.

Despite the higher market levels, tariffs have been reduced across all major trading partners as the U.S. enters a phase of negotiation. This reduction in tariffs suggests that trade-related upside catalysts may be diminishing. However, there is also the potential for trade tensions to re-escalate during these talks. Moreover, the economy is expected to experience a period of adjustment to the higher tariffs that remain in place.

Lefkowitz notes that while the economy may face some softening in the coming months due to these adjustments, they do not foresee a significant downside risk to U.S. equities, rather a possible modest headwind. They maintain that the bull market is still in progress and anticipate that stock prices will continue to rise over the next year. Economic data is expected to improve later in the year, bolstered by real wage growth, clarity on tax policy, deregulation, and possible Federal Reserve rate cuts.

The conclusion of the first quarter earnings season has also shed light on the ongoing strength of AI investment. Companies like Meta (NASDAQ: ) have increased their capital spending plans for 2025, while Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) reported exceptional cloud revenue growth and confirmed increasing data center capital expenditures. Industrial and power companies serving data centers have echoed this positive sentiment.

In light of a strong earnings season and a slightly more optimistic GDP growth forecast for the latter half of the year, analysts have revised their S&P 500 earnings per share (EPS) estimates.

META,2025-05-22,16:01,"Apple plans smart glasses launch in 2026, Bloomberg News reports By Reuters","(Reuters) -Apple plans to release smart glasses at the end of next year, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday, in the iPhone maker’s latest push to diversify its product lineup and boost demand for its artificial intelligence devices.

Apple (NASDAQ: ) will start producing large quantities of prototypes of the devices at the end of this year with overseas suppliers, the report said, citing people with knowledge of the matter.

Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The company’s push into facewear comes after its Vision Pro headset saw lukewarm reception from the public due to its hefty price tag and lack of AI features.

Apple’s new glasses will compete with Facebook-parent Meta (NASDAQ: )’s Ray-Ban smart glasses, which have become popular with consumers.

Apple also shelved plans for a smartwatch that can analyze its surroundings with a built-in camera, the report said.

The company had actively been working to release a camera-equipped Apple Watch by 2027, but that work was shut down, the report added.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/apple-plans-smart-glasses-launch-in-2026-bloomberg-news-reports-4060597
META,2025-05-22,15:46,"Apple eyes 2026 smart glasses launch amid AI hardware race, Bloomberg reports By Investing.com","Investing.com -- Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) is accelerating development on smart glasses targeted for release in late 2026, marking a deeper push into AI-integrated consumer hardware, Bloomberg reported earlier. The iPhone maker has shelved a previously considered Apple Watch with a built-in camera, shifting focus entirely toward glasses that could rival Meta Platforms’ (NASDAQ: ) Ray-Ban partnership and Google’s (NASDAQ: ) recently-announced partnership with Warby Parker (NYSE: ) for AI glasses.

Sources familiar with the roadmap told Bloomberg that Apple plans to begin large-scale prototype production with overseas suppliers by the end of this year. The N401 project, as it is now known internally, represents a wider effort to introduce ambient computing wearables powered by Apple’s AI systems, including Siri.

The glasses are expected to support cameras, microphones, and speakers, enabling them to analyze the user’s surroundings and perform voice-activated tasks. The device would handle functions such as phone calls, music playback, turn-by-turn navigation, and real-time translation, mirroring capabilities found in Meta’s latest Ray-Ban smart glasses.

This has been a pivotal week for AI and hardware competition, with multiple announcements signaling heightened urgency in the space. On Wednesday, OpenAI said it would acquire Jony Ive’s secretive AI hardware startup, io, in a move aimed at developing devices that may one day challenge the iPhone’s ubiquity.

Ive is Apple’s former Chief Design Officer and helped define the aesthetics of the iPhone and Apple Watch. OpenAI’s plan to release its first hardware products next year suggests that competition for ambient AI wearables is not only intensifying but also threatening Apple on its home turf.

Meanwhile, at Google’s Tuesday I/O developer conference, the company announced its smart glasses alongside a partnership with Warby Parker aimed at creating lighter, more comfortable AI-powered frames. This signals serious intent from Alphabet to gain a foothold in AI-native wearables while bringing its technology to retail scale.

Apple remains committed to releasing eventual augmented reality (AR) spectacles that merge digital content directly into the user’s field of view. Those plans are still years away, positioning the 2026 smart glasses as a precursor to the company’s long-term AR vision and its response to a rapidly evolving AI hardware landscape.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/apple-eyes-2026-smart-glasses-launch-amid-ai-hardware-race-bloomberg-reports-4060561

House passes tax and spending bill

U.S. President Donald Trump’s tax and spending bill narrowly passed the House of Representatives on Thursday morning, overcoming days of political wrangling between Republicans in control of the lower chamber of Congress.

The measure passed by a narrow 215-214 margin, with one member voting present, as all Democrats opposed the bill.

The bill now moves to the Senate, where some lawmakers are pushing for revisions, with a vote on approval expected by August.

The U.S. House Rules Committee on late Wednesday approved President Donald Trump’s expansive tax and spending bill after a nearly 22-hour session, media reports showed.

Along with the extension of 2017 tax cuts, the legislation would slash taxes charged on tips and car loans, while boosting spending on defense and border security. Reductions to key food and health programs for low-income Americans are also included in the bill.

Nonpartisan analysts have said the changes would add between $3 trillion to $5 trillion to the U.S.’s $36.2 trillion debt load.

Earlier, it was uncertain if House Speaker Mike Johnson would secure enough Republican support to pass the bill. Some GOP lawmakers demanded deeper spending cuts to offset Trump’s desired tax breaks, although Johnson said he was confident he could secure their backing to overcome united Democratic opposition.

hits record high

Bitcoin surged to a fresh record high above $111,000 on Thursday, driven by optimism over U.S. regulatory progress, particularly the advancement of the GENIUS Act aimed at establishing a national framework for stablecoins.

As of 6:00 ET, Bitcoin ( ) was up 2.3%, pricing in at $110,881. The cryptocurrency has climbed over 18% in May so far.

Crude falls on OPEC+ output talk

Oil prices fell further Thursday on renewed oversupply concerns, following a report suggesting that a group of top producers was considering raising output levels once more.

At 6:00 ET, Futures fell 1.3% to $64.07 per barrel and futures dropped 0.2% to $60.64 per barrel.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, a group known as OPEC+, is discussing whether to agree on another large production increase at their meeting on June 1, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday.

An output hike of 411,000 barrels a day (bpd) for July is among the options under discussion, although no final agreement has yet been reached, the report said, citing delegates.

OPEC+ has been in the process of unwinding output cuts, with additions to the market in May and June.

Gold prices inch lower

Gold prices dipped in European trade on Thursday, pulling back from recent gains due to a strengthening in the U.S. that threatens the appeal of bullion from holders of foreign currencies.

However, demand for safe havens somewhat remained bolstered by persistent concerns over high U.S. debt levels and the passage of Trump’s tax bill.

META,2025-05-22,05:17,Deutsche Bank lists 5 key takeaways from the GENIUS Act By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- The U.S. Senate voted 66-32 on Monday to advance the GENIUS Act, a landmark stablecoin regulation bill that has rapidly gained bipartisan momentum. The vote sets up a final vote as early as next week, with the bill then expected to move to the House of Representatives.

The GENIUS Act sets regulatory standards for stablecoins, requiring issuers to back their tokens with reserves of assets like U.S. dollars or Treasuries to reduce volatility and protect consumers.

It also mandates priority repayment for coin holders in bankruptcy and enforces anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism compliance.

While a presidential signature is still weeks away, Deutsche Bank has released its assessment of the bill’s implications for markets, technology, and the dollar.

1) ‘Stablecoin legislation cements USD supremacy:’ The GENIUS Act requires all stablecoins to be fully backed by low-risk liquid assets such as short-dated U.S. Treasuries, insured bank deposits, or physical dollars. Monthly reserve disclosures will be mandatory.

This framework enshrines practices already adopted by major players like , whose USD-pegged coins represent over 61% of the stablecoin market cap.

According to Deutsche Bank analysts, the regulation “formalizes stablecoin issuers’ role as quasi money market funds,” deepening their integration into the U.S. financial system.

2) ‘Big Tech’s stablecoin ambitions are curtailed:’ Revisions to the bill block tech giants like Meta (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) from issuing stablecoins unless they meet strict criteria on financial risk, data privacy and fair conduct.

Lawmakers have cited concerns that tech monopolies could use their vast ecosystems to dominate financial infrastructure, echoing the backlash that derailed Meta’s Libra in 2019.

“It underscores Congress’s preference for payment-focused fintechs over platform giants when it comes to monetary innovation,” analysts Marion Laboure and Camilla Siazon explained.

“The government appears keen to preserve USD dominance—especially as a tool to shore up U.S. debt—while curtailing any threat to its primacy from private tech monopolies,” they added.

3) ‘Tether’s ambitions are also checked:’ Foreign issuers, particularly Tether, will now face tighter oversight.

A new “Stablecoin Certification Review Committee” along with the Treasury Secretary will have authority to regulate offshore providers.

According to Deutsche’s team, this addresses a prior loophole that allowed foreign issuers to operate with fewer constraints, provided they could restrict transfers when requested by law enforcement.

“Tether and other offshore issuers will now be subject to the same regulatory framework as U.S.-based stablecoin providers,” the bank notes.

4) ‘No yield-bearing stablecoins – but the market is growing:’ The GENIUS Act bans interest or yield payments on regulated stablecoins.

That limitation may steer investors toward tokenized money market funds. Still, interest-bearing coins are gaining traction, with Deutsche Bank noting they already account for 2.8% of the $247 billion stablecoin space.

5) ‘Political conflicts of interest cloud the legislative push:’ The bill has not escaped controversy. President Trump’s links to crypto, including the World Liberty Financial’s rapidly growing USD1 stablecoin, have drawn criticism.

Senator Elizabeth Warren said the bill “would turbocharge Trump’s corruption,” warning it could enable “anonymous foreign intermediaries” to funnel funds to his network. Since late April, USD1 has surged from $128 million to over $2 billion in market cap.",https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/deutsche-bank-lists-5-key-takeaways-from-the-genius-act-4058921

LoveFrom, the design firm founded by Ive after leaving Apple (NASDAQ: ), has been working with OpenAI for two years on generative AI devices - an area where startups have stumbled due to high computing demands, including flops such as Humane’s AI Pin.

With Ive leading design, OpenAI aims to pair the technology behind its popular ChatGPT chatbot with the product design expertise that made devices such as the iPhone bestsellers.

OpenAI had previously owned a 23% stake in the company, according to the source who requested anonymity to discuss private matters.

""The products that we’re using to deliver and connect us to unimaginable technology. They’re decades old, yeah, and so it’s just common sense to at least think surely there’s something beyond these legacy products we have,"" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Ive said in a video posted on OpenAI’s blog.

Altman said they had a prototype of a device without giving further details, but called it ""the coolest piece of technology the world will have ever seen"".

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It’s shares fell more than 2% on the news.

The iPhone maker has been slow to roll out Apple Intelligence, a set of features with access to ChatGPT, with several advanced AI tools available on competing Android smartphones.

""OpenAI is interested in owning the next hardware platform so they don’t have to sell their products through Apple iOS or Google (NASDAQ: )’s Android,"" D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria said.

NVDA,2025-05-27,22:52,Asia stocks rise tracking Wall St gains; Tech upbeat before Nvidia earnings By Investing.com,"Investing.com-- Most Asian stocks rose on Wednesday tracking a strong overnight session on Wall Street, as investors cheered President Donald Trump’s postponement of steep trade tariffs against Europe.

Technology stocks led gains for the day, buoyed by stellar earnings from China’s Xiaomi (OTC: ) (HK: ), and as investors piled into the sector before earnings from artificial intelligence major NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: ), which are due later today.

Gains in Asian markets came tracking a sharp overnight jump in Wall Street, as investors also cheered some signs of stability in the bond market. U.S. stock index futures were flat in regional trade, with steady around 5,934.0 points after the surged over 2%.

Some regional markets also lagged, with Australian shares rising marginally after a strong consumer inflation print.

Chinese shares moved in a flat-to-low range as weak earnings from ecommerce giant PDD Holdings (NASDAQ: ) added to concerns over sustained deflation and weak consumer spending in the country.

Tech stocks advance with Nvidia earnings in focus

Japan’s rose 0.6%, while South Korea’s rallied 1.8% to a nine-month high on outsized gains in technology stocks.

Japan’s Advantest Corp. (TYO: )- an Nvidia supplier- rose 2.2%, while South Korea’s SK Hynix Inc (KS: ) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS: ), who both supply Nvidia with memory chips– rose 2.7% and 3.3%, respectively.

Taiwan’s TSMC (TW: ) and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (TW: ) (Foxconn) rose about 0.5% each.

Investors were seen piling into tech, especially in chipmakers and AI-tangential stocks, as they positioned for a strong earnings print from Nvidia.

The AI major is set to report earnings after the U.S. close on Wednesday, and is forecast to clock strong earnings and revenue growth, as it continued to benefit from outsized spending on AI infrastructure, especially by major U.S. companies.

But focus will be on Nvidia’s outlook on AI demand and China, especially as the company grapples with stricter U.S. restrictions on chip exports to Beijing.

China shares lag, deflation concerns outweigh strong Xiaomi earnings

China’s and indexes fell marginally, while Hong Kong’s shed 0.3%.

Concerns over Chinese deflation and weak consumer spending came to fore this week following weak earnings from ecommerce major PDD. The company’s first-quarter profit nearly halved as local sales suffered from heightened competition and weak spending, while its international business, specifically budget marketplace Temu, was hit by heightened uncertainty over U.S. trade tariffs.

PDD’s weak print comes just a week after ecommerce major Alibaba’s earnings underwhelmed.

Concerns over deflation largely offset a strong showing from Xiaomi, which clocked a record first quarter profit. Xiaomi’s shares rose 1.6% in Hong Kong trade.

Broader Asian markets mostly advanced, although gains were limited in several markets. Australia’s rose 0.2%, lagging its regional peers as mildly stronger than expected raised some doubts over when the Reserve Bank of Australia will cut interest rates next.

Singapore’s index rose 0.4%, while Japan’s index rose 0.5%.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian shares continued a rally from Wall Street and the dollar held gains on Wednesday on promising economic signs in the United States and speculation of strong tech earnings.

Markets welcomed what appeared to be easing trade frictions between the U.S. and Europe while global bond markets settled down after a scary surge in long-term yields. U.S. consumer confidence surprised on the upside ahead of closely watched jobs figures on Thursday.

Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) jumped more than 4% yesterday and will be the last of the Magnificent 7 tech giants to report earnings after markets close in the U.S.

""There is renewed confidence that Nvidia can beat the consensus estimates,"" said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone.

If Nvidia comes through with better-than-expected sales and profit margins ""the rally is on,"" he added.

The chipmaker is expected to report that first-quarter revenue surged 66.2% to $43.28 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.

In signs of a thaw between the U.S. and Europe, European Union officials have asked companies for details of their U.S. investment plans, according to two sources familiar with the matter.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.3% in morning trading while advanced 0.6%, climbing a fourth straight session.

Australian shares were up 0.17%, but the nation’s currency slid 0.2% after April consumer price data came in above expectations. The dollar slid 0.3% after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand cut rates as expected.

Japanese bonds slid, trimming a surge yesterday, ahead of a 40-year auction and on speculation the Ministry of Finance will reduce the issuance of long-dated securities.

Futures steadied after a stellar session on Wall Street, as investors cheered President Donald Trump’s delaying of steep trade tariffs against the European Union, while stronger-than-expected consumer confidence data pointed to resilience in the economy.

Technology stocks also courted heavy buying before Nvidia’s earnings, which are likely to act as a bellwether for the sector. Analysts expect another strong quarter from the chipmaker.

Nvidia Q1 earnings awaited for more AI cues; shares surge

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: ) is set to report its first-quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday, with analysts expecting a strong print.

Shares of the AI major surged 3.2% on Tuesday and were flat in after-hours trade.

Nvidia is forecast to post earnings per share of $0.893 on revenue of $43.12 billion for the three months to April 31, both up substantially from last year, Investing.com data showed.

The chipmaker is expected to have benefited from outsized domestic demand, especially as its biggest customers– Wall Street’s so-called AI hyperscalers– continued spending billions on building more data center capacity.

But focus will be on Nvidia’s outlook, which is likely to set the tone for the tech industry going forward in 2025. Investors will also be watching for comments on Nvidia’s China sales, as the company grapples with more U.S. export controls and increased competition in the country.

CEO Jensen Huang recently criticized the U.S. export restrictions, calling them a ""failure,"" and also forecast China becoming a $50 billion market in the coming years.

Wall St rises on Trump tariff delay, strong consumer sentiment

Wall Street clocked strong gains on Tuesday, after Trump’s delaying of 50% tariffs against the EU boosted risk appetite. Trump’s move– which is another instance of the president flip-flopping on his tariff plans– spurred bets that he will not deliver on his agenda of imposing steep reciprocal trade tariffs in July.

Sentiment was also boosted by substantially stronger than expected data for May, which rebounded after five months of declines.

The rebound also comes following a deescalation in trade tensions between the U.S. and China, and as Trump’s administration attempts to reach trade deals with several major economies.

The purchases, potentially totaling hundreds of billions to 1 trillion yen, would be supported by Japanese government subsidies to domestic firms acquiring chips from companies such as NVIDIA (NASDAQ: ), the report said.

Tokyo aims to use the offer as a “negotiating card” to address the U.S. trade deficit with Japan, which currently stands at approximately 10 trillion yen, the Asahi said.

Nvidia, which commands about 80% of the data center semiconductor market, is a key supplier in the proposal, according to the report.

NVDA,2025-05-27,17:36,"Munster previews NVIDIA’s earnings, highlights U.S. chip restrictions By Investing.com","Investing.com -- Deepwater Asset Management’s Managing Partner, Gene Munster, recently shared his insights on Nvidia (NASDAQ: )’s forthcoming earnings release, highlighting the impact of U.S. chip restrictions on China and the potential for the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) buildout.

According to Munster, investors should expect three key takeaways from Nvidia’s earnings results for April and guidance for June. Firstly, the U.S. chip restrictions on China are likely to reduce Nvidia’s revenue by approximately $15 billion over the next three quarters. This, however, sets up easier year-on-year comparisons for calendar year 2026 (CY26) in China. Secondly, the AI expansion is still in its early stages and could partially offset the effects of the export curbs. Lastly, the revenue growth in CY26 is expected to surpass the current Street expectation of 24%.

The U.S. chip curbs are anticipated to lead to downward revisions in Street revenue growth estimates for calendar year 2025 (CY25), from the current expectation of 56% to around 40% year on year. Despite this, underlying GPU demand continues to soar, which investors are likely to view as the most significant update.

In April, the U.S. government imposed new export controls, prohibiting the shipment of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) GPUs to China, effectively sidelining Nvidia’s H20 chip. This led to a one-time $5.5 billion write-off of inventory in the April quarter. Deepwater estimates that about 25% of Nvidia’s FY25 revenue, or $50 billion in CY25, was effectively China-related. This includes $20 billion through authorized channels of H20 sales and another $30 billion going to third parties, many stationed outside of China, that supply China with Nvidia GPUs.

To regain this revenue segment, Nvidia is reportedly fast-tracking a “Blackwell-lite” chip that could ship as soon as June, adding back about $5 billion in revenue each quarter it’s in the market. For the July guide, buy-side models have already marked revenue estimates down to roughly $38 billion, down $7 billion vs. the imprint estimates of $45 billion, to reflect the U.S. curbs.

Munster also pointed out that the demand from non-China customers is exceeding expectations, indicating that the dip is temporary and tied to export paperwork, not end-market weakness. The AI infrastructure spending ramp is intact, with xAI’s ‘Colossus’ data center reportedly targeting roughly one million Blackwell GPUs, which would account for about $30–$40 billion worth of Nvidia hardware over the next two years. If this goes through, xAI alone would account for almost 8% of revenue over the next two years.

Furthermore, Apple (NASDAQ: )’s plans to close the AI gap and step up investment from its current $5 billion AI run rate could add a new 2–4% customer to Nvidia’s book. The Street calls for 56% revenue growth in CY25 and just 26% in CY26, but hyperscaler capex plans suggest CY26 growth could accelerate.

In the long term, owning Nvidia remains the cleanest way to invest in the AI buildout, according to Munster. Street revenue expectations for CY26 are roughly $245 billion, but Deepwater believes they are 10% too low, implying Nvidia trades closer to 20x forward EPS once the upward revisions flow through. If management reiterates that late in CY25, revenue will re-accelerate as additional Blackwell supply hits the channel, then the multiple on Nvidia has room to expand.

ORLANDO, Florida (Reuters) - TRADING DAY

Making sense of the forces driving global markets

By Jamie McGeever, Markets Columnist

Reasons to be cheerful

A tariff reprieve from U.S. President Donald Trump, a surprise bounce in U.S. consumer confidence and a slide in government bond yields sparked a rally across most markets on Tuesday, particularly U.S. assets, with Wall Street, Treasuries and the dollar all outperforming.

In my column today I look at how much the dollar may need to fall if the Trump administration is to succeed in making a significant dent in the U.S. trade deficit. More on that below, but first, a roundup of the main market moves.

If you have more time to read, here are a few articles I recommend to help you make sense of what happened in markets today. 1. Long bond blues stress the ’bedrock’: Mike Dolan 2. Japan to consider trimming super-long bond issuance,sources say 3. Japan net external assets hit record, but surrendersworld’s top creditor spot 4. Investors see worsening US deficit outlook as tax billheads to Senate 5. Brussels seeks companies’ US spending plans as Trumphails move toward talks

Today’s Key Market Moves * Wall Street has its best day in two weeks, with the S&P500 snapping a four-day losing run to gain 2% and the Nasdaqrising 2.5%. * Every sector on the rises. Consumer cyclicals leadthe way, up 3%, as investors bet on stronger growth. * Japan’s 30-year bond yield slides 16 bps, its biggestfall since August 5 last year, one of its largest ever. The40-year yield’s 25 bps fall is a record. * The 30-year U.S. Treasury yield slumps 9 bps, its biggestfall since April 4. * The rises 0.5%, driven by the greenback’s1% rise against the yen, its best day in two weeks.

Japan spreads long bond relief

Global liquidity returned to more normal levels on Tuesday as UK and U.S. markets re-opened after the long weekend, and investors mostly scooped up whatever they could get their hands on.

There were good reasons to feel bullish: President Trump extending his deadline for imposing 50% tariffs on European Union goods to July 9, relief at the long end of the Japanese Government Bond market, and a spike in U.S. consumer confidence.

There will be more back-and-forth in Trump’s tariff pronouncements in the weeks ahead, and there is a case to make that each positive turn will deliver diminishing returns for markets. The next big deadline is July 9, when Trump’s pause on his reciprocal tariffs with the rest of the world also expires.

Similarly, consumer confidence in the U.S. and elsewhere is liable to be volatile, difficult to predict amid such heightened uncertainty, and susceptible to the tariff headlines of the day.

That said, if Trump’s tariffs deliver a one-off price shock and no lasting inflationary pressure beyond that, consumer confidence may continue to improve. Economists at Citi, for example, forecast year-end inflation of 3.2%, not too much higher than the current rate of around 2.5-2.7% and well below some of the gloomier forecasts of 4% or higher.

Perhaps the most interesting market moves of the day came from Japan, where ultra-long yields clocked some of their steepest one-day falls after sources told Reuters the Ministry of Finance may consider trimming issuance of long-dated paper.

These yields had last week spiked to record highs on growing jitters about Tokyo’s deteriorating public finances and an alarming drop off in investor demand. Tuesday’s rally in JGBs spread to long-dated U.S. bonds, which have also come under heavy selling pressure on concerns about Washington’s fiscal indiscipline and drawn weak demand at auction too.

Analysts at Morgan Stanley on Monday recommended going outright long on 10-year Japanese Government Bonds at 1.505%, which was the yield’s high that day. But they remain more cautious on the long end, despite Tuesday’s rebound.

A more ""lasting solution"" to the recent market turbulence, they argue, will require an increase in Bank of Japan purchases or less supply from the Ministry of Finance. Or both.

Looking ahead to Wednesday, the global session will kick off with an expected interest rate cut in New Zealand, span a 40-year bond auction in Japan and a five-year note sale in the United States, and wrap up with chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ: )’s quarterly earnings after the Wall Street close.

Historic dollar fall needed to eliminate US trade deficit

If the United States is to significantly reduce or, whisper it, eliminate its trade deficit, the dollar will probably have to weaken a lot. How much is unclear, though, as history shows large dollar declines are rare and have unpredictable consequences for trade.

Reducing the U.S. trade deficit is the key goal of Trump’s economic agenda because he believes it reflects decades of other countries ""ripping off"" America to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars annually.

Stephen Miran, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, published a paper in November titled ""A User’s Guide to Restructuring the Global Trading System"" in which he argued that the dollar is ""persistently over-valued"" from a trade perspective. ""Sweeping tariffs and a shift away from strong dollar policy"" could fundamentally reshape the global trade and financial systems.

If a weaker exchange rate is the Trump administration’s goal, it is on the right track, with the greenback down nearly 10% this year on the back of growing concerns over Washington’s fiscal trajectory and policy credibility, as well as the end of ""U.S. exceptionalism"" and the ""safe haven"" status of Treasuries.

But it is good to remember that a 15% fall in the dollar during Trump’s first term had no impact on the trade deficit, which remained between 2.5% and 3.0% of GDP until the pandemic. Making a dent in the U.S. deficit will therefore require a much bigger move.

WEIGHT OF HISTORY

Reducing the trade deficit will be a challenge, eliminating it without a recession, a historic feat. The United States has run a persistent deficit for the past half-century, as insatiable consumer demand has sucked in goods from around the world and voracious appetite for U.S. assets from overseas has kept capital flowing stateside.

The only exception was in the third quarter of 1980, when the U.S. posted a slender trade surplus of 0.2% of GDP, and trade with the rest of the world almost briefly balanced in 1982 and 1991-92.

But these periods all coincided with - or were the result of - sharp slowdowns in U.S. economic activity that ultimately ended in recession. As growth shrank, import demand slumped and the trade gap narrowed.

The dollar only played a significant role in one of them. In 1987, the trade gap was a then-record 3.1% of GDP. But it had almost disappeared by the early 1990s, largely because of the dollar’s 50% devaluation from 1985-87, its biggest-ever depreciation.

That three-year decline was accelerated by the Plaza Accord in September 1985, a coordinated response between the world’s economic powers to weaken the dollar following its parabolic rise in the first half of the 1980s.

But that does not mean large depreciations always coincide with reductions in the trade deficit.

The dollar’s second-largest decline was a 40% fall between 2002 and mid-2008, just before Lehman Brothers collapsed. But the U.S. trade deficit actually widened throughout most of that period, peaking at a record 6% of GDP in 2005. While it had shrunk by more than three percentage points by 2009, that was due more to plunging imports during the Great Recession than the exchange rate.

These two episodes of deep, protracted dollar depreciation stand out because over the past 50 years, the dollar index has only had two other declines exceeding 20%, in 1977-78 and the early 1990s, and a few other slides of 15-20%. None of these had any discernible impact on the U.S. trade balance.

DEFICIT TO ’VANISH’?

The U.S. administration is correct that the dollar is historically strong today by several broad measures. Given that Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent seem intent on rebalancing global trade, pressure on the greenback looks unlikely to lift any time soon.

But how much would the dollar have to fall to whittle away the yawning trade deficit, which last year totaled $918 billion, or 3.1% of GDP?

Hedge fund manager Andreas Steno Larsen reckons a 20%-25% depreciation over the next two years would see the deficit ""vanish,"" while Deutsche Bank’s Peter Hooper thinks a 20%-30% depreciation could be enough to ""eventually"" narrow the deficit by about 3% of GDP.

""This means that a significant reversal of the roughly 40% appreciation of the dollar in real (price-adjusted) terms against a broad set of currencies since 2010 could be sufficient to get the current deficit back to a zero balance,"" Hooper wrote last week.

History suggests this may be challenging without a severe economic slowdown. But that’s a risk the administration seems prepared to accept.

What could move markets tomorrow? * Australia CPI inflation (April) * New Zealand interest rate decision * Taiwan GDP (Q1, revised) * India industrial production (April) * Germany unemployment (April) * U.S. 5-year note auction * New York Fed President John Williams speaks at BOJ-hostedconference in Tokyo * Nvidia quarterly earnings after the closing bell

NVDA,2025-05-27,16:41,Nvidia suppliers ramp up AI server production after technical snag,"Investing.com -- NVIDIA (NASDAQ: ) suppliers, including industry leaders like Foxconn (SS: ), Inventec, Dell (NYSE: ), and Wistron, have overcome technical challenges that previously delayed shipments of Nvidia’s flagship AI data center racks, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday. This development marks a significant stride in the company’s efforts to enhance its global sales initiatives.

The technical issues, which arose toward the end of last year, had impeded the production of the highly anticipated ""Blackwell"" AI servers. These servers are expected to substantially boost computing power for training and utilizing large language models, a promise made by Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, upon the product’s announcement last year.

The resolution of these technical difficulties is a welcome relief for Nvidia, as it aims to meet its ambitious annual sales targets. The suppliers’ breakthroughs have enabled the commencement of shipments, which is likely to contribute positively to the company’s performance.

Nvidia’s Blackwell AI servers are part of a broader strategy to solidify the chipmaker’s position in the rapidly growing field of artificial intelligence. The successful deployment of these servers is crucial for the company to maintain its competitive edge and fulfill the expectations set by its leadership.

This latest advancement underscores Nvidia’s resilience in addressing production challenges and reaffirms its commitment to delivering cutting-edge technology solutions to its customers. As shipments begin, the market is watching closely to see how this will translate into financial performance for the semiconductor giant in the coming quarters.

NVDA,2025-05-27,12:26,"NVIDIA’s SWOT analysis: ai chip giant faces export hurdles, eyes new growth By Investing.com","NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: ), the leading graphics processing unit (GPU) and artificial intelligence (AI) chip manufacturer, with a market capitalization of $3.3 trillion, finds itself at a critical juncture as it navigates new export restrictions while maintaining its dominant position in the rapidly evolving AI market. According to InvestingPro analysis, NVIDIA maintains excellent financial health with a ""GREAT"" overall score and a perfect Piotroski Score of 9, indicating strong operational efficiency and financial stability. Recent regulatory changes have forced the company to reassess its strategy in China, one of its largest markets, while simultaneously pursuing new growth opportunities in AI infrastructure and emerging applications.

Export Restrictions and Financial Impact

In a significant development, the U.S. government recently imposed new export restrictions requiring licenses for NVIDIA to sell its H20 chips to companies headquartered in China, Hong Kong, Macau, and embargoed countries. This regulatory shift has had an immediate and substantial impact on NVIDIA’s financial outlook.

The company announced a $5.5 billion write-down related to inventory and purchase commitments for the April 2025 quarter. This charge reflects the uncertainty surrounding future sales of H20 products in the affected markets. Analysts estimate that sales to China or Chinese companies account for 10-40% of NVIDIA’s revenues, with the higher end being more likely.

NVIDIA’s management has responded swiftly to these challenges. The company is exploring the development of new, China-compliant products to maintain its presence in this crucial market. Additionally, NVIDIA has announced a $500 billion AI infrastructure initiative, signaling its commitment to long-term growth and innovation despite near-term headwinds.

Market Position and Technology Leadership

Despite the regulatory challenges, NVIDIA maintains a strong position in the AI and machine learning markets. The company’s CUDA ecosystem and superior AI compute solutions continue to drive its market dominance. NVIDIA’s GPUs are widely regarded as the gold standard for AI training and inference tasks, giving the company a significant competitive advantage. This leadership is reflected in NVIDIA’s impressive 114.2% revenue growth over the last twelve months, reaching $130.5 billion. Want deeper insights? InvestingPro offers 18 additional exclusive tips about NVIDIA’s performance and prospects.

The company’s upcoming product cycles, including the ramp-up of its Blackwell (GB200) architecture and the anticipated launch of GB300, are expected to further solidify its technological leadership. These new products are designed to meet the growing demand for AI computing power across various industries.

Financial Performance and Outlook

The export restrictions have led analysts to revise their near-term financial projections for NVIDIA. Trading at a P/E ratio of 45.58, the stock currently shows mixed valuation signals based on InvestingPro’s Fair Value analysis. Consensus estimates for fiscal year 2026 (FY26) earnings per share (EPS) have been adjusted downward, with most analysts now expecting EPS in the range of $3.45 to $4.52. The company maintains strong liquidity with a current ratio of 4.44, providing flexibility to navigate market challenges. However, longer-term projections remain optimistic, with FY27 EPS estimates ranging from $5.08 to $5.84.

Revenue forecasts have also been impacted, with analysts reducing their expectations for the current fiscal year. However, many still anticipate strong growth, with some projecting revenues to reach $189 billion to $209 billion in FY26, driven by continued demand for AI chips and infrastructure.

Competitive Landscape

While NVIDIA currently dominates the AI chip market, the landscape is becoming increasingly competitive. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) is making strides in the data center GPU market, potentially challenging NVIDIA’s market share. Additionally, the emergence of Huawei’s Ascend chip presents a new competitive threat, particularly in the Chinese market where NVIDIA faces export restrictions.

Despite these challenges, analysts believe that NVIDIA’s technological edge and extensive software ecosystem will help maintain its leadership position. The company’s focus on innovation and its ability to deliver comprehensive solutions for AI workloads continue to set it apart from competitors.

Growth Drivers and Opportunities

Several factors are expected to drive NVIDIA’s growth in the coming years:

1. AI Infrastructure Buildout: The company’s $500 billion AI infrastructure initiative positions it to capitalize on the growing demand for AI computing resources.

2. Emerging AI Applications: As AI technology becomes more pervasive across industries, new applications are likely to emerge, creating additional demand for NVIDIA’s products.

3. Cloud Gaming and Metaverse: NVIDIA’s GPUs are well-suited for cloud gaming platforms and metaverse applications, both of which are expected to see significant growth.

4. Automotive and Edge Computing: The company’s solutions for autonomous vehicles and edge AI applications represent growing market opportunities.

Risks and Challenges

While NVIDIA’s long-term prospects remain strong, the company faces several near-term challenges:

1. Geopolitical Tensions: Ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China could further impact NVIDIA’s ability to sell its products in key markets.

2. Supply Chain Risks: NVIDIA’s dependence on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) for chip production exposes it to potential disruptions in the event of geopolitical conflicts or production issues.

3. Market Cyclicality: The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and the gaming market could lead to periods of volatility in NVIDIA’s financial performance.

4. Increased Competition: As more companies enter the AI chip market, NVIDIA may face pressure on its market share and margins.

Bear Case

How will export restrictions impact NVIDIA’s market share in China?

The new export restrictions on H20 chips to China pose a significant threat to NVIDIA’s market position in one of its largest markets. With sales to China potentially accounting for up to 40% of the company’s revenues, the inability to freely sell its most advanced AI chips in this market could lead to a substantial loss of market share.

Chinese companies may be forced to seek alternative solutions, potentially turning to domestic suppliers like Huawei or other international competitors not subject to the same restrictions. This could result in a long-term erosion of NVIDIA’s dominance in the Chinese AI chip market, even if the company develops new China-compliant products.

Can competitors gain ground during this period of uncertainty?

The current regulatory challenges facing NVIDIA create an opportunity for competitors to gain market share, particularly in China. AMD, which has been making significant strides in the data center GPU market, could capitalize on NVIDIA’s export restrictions to expand its presence in the Chinese market.

Additionally, domestic Chinese chip manufacturers may use this opportunity to accelerate their development efforts and close the technology gap with NVIDIA. If these competitors can offer viable alternatives to NVIDIA’s products, it could lead to a more fragmented market and increased pricing pressure in the long term.

Bull Case

How might NVIDIA overcome export challenges and maintain growth?

NVIDIA has a history of successfully navigating regulatory challenges and adapting its product lineup to meet market demands. The company’s plan to develop new China-compliant GPUs could help mitigate the impact of export restrictions and maintain its presence in the Chinese market.

Furthermore, NVIDIA’s strong position in other global markets, particularly in North America and Europe, provides a solid foundation for continued growth. The company’s focus on AI infrastructure investments and emerging applications could open up new revenue streams that offset any losses in the Chinese market.

What new opportunities could emerge from AI infrastructure investments?

NVIDIA’s $500 billion AI infrastructure initiative positions the company to capitalize on the growing demand for AI computing resources across various industries. This investment could lead to the development of new products and services tailored to specific AI workloads, further entrenching NVIDIA’s leadership in the AI ecosystem.

The expansion of AI infrastructure could also drive demand for NVIDIA’s high-performance computing solutions beyond traditional data centers. Emerging applications in edge computing, autonomous vehicles, and industrial AI could create new markets for NVIDIA’s products, supporting long-term growth and diversification of revenue streams.

NVDA,2025-05-27,10:05,"Cantor Fitzgerald maintains overweight on NVIDIA stock, $200 target By Investing.com","On Tuesday, Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed its positive stance on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: ), maintaining an Overweight rating and a $200.00 price target. The semiconductor giant, currently valued at $3.29 trillion, boasts a perfect Piotroski Score of 9 according to InvestingPro data, indicating exceptional financial strength. The firm’s analyst highlighted the upcoming May 28th earnings call as a potential catalyst for the company, suggesting it could clarify concerns and provide a positive outlook. Despite an anticipated $15 billion loss in Data Center revenues for the full year of 2025 due to restrictions in China, the analyst predicts a more optimistic revenue guide for the July quarter at $46.0 billion, slightly below the consensus of $46.3 billion. This comes as NVIDIA demonstrates strong momentum with 114.2% revenue growth over the last twelve months, though currently trading at a P/E ratio of 44.4x. This forecast accounts for a $5 billion impact from the China headwinds, which is expected to be mitigated by a significant ramp-up in NVIDIA’s Blackwell products.

The analyst anticipates that NVIDIA’s management will address a robust second-half demand environment for Data Centers during the earnings call. This is supported by increased visibility into the acceleration of rack-scale shipments, particularly with the GB300 product line, which is projected to reach approximately 25,000 units for the entire year of 2025. Based on these factors, Cantor Fitzgerald expects NVIDIA to achieve an earnings per share (EPS) of $5.00 in the calendar year 2025, exceeding the consensus estimate of $4.37, and anticipates EPS to grow to between $6.50 and $7.00 in the calendar year 2026, significantly above the consensus of $5.59.

The firm’s continued confidence in NVIDIA is driven by the expectation of revenue reacceleration in the second half of 2025. The analyst’s outlook suggests that NVIDIA is on a solid path to meet these projections, leading to the reaffirmation of the Overweight rating and the $200 price target. NVIDIA shares are also listed as a top pick by the analyst, indicating a strong conviction in the stock’s potential performance. InvestingPro analysis reveals over 15 additional investment tips for NVIDIA, along with comprehensive valuation metrics and growth indicators available in the Pro Research Report, helping investors make more informed decisions about this semiconductor leader.

In other recent news, NVIDIA is set to release its earnings report, with analysts from Piper Sandler maintaining an Overweight rating and a $150 price target, despite potential short-term revenue challenges. Piper Sandler’s Harsh Kumar suggests that macroeconomic uncertainties and the H20 ban could impact NVIDIA’s April quarter results, but remains optimistic about the latter half of the year. Meanwhile, BofA Securities continues to support NVIDIA with a Buy rating and a $160 price target, citing the company’s strategic role in the global AI deployment cycle. BofA’s Vivek Arya highlights a potential recovery in NVIDIA’s gross margins and China sales later this year.

Additionally, Stifel analysts have reiterated their Buy rating with a $180 price target on NVIDIA stock, forecasting a significant increase in business activities in the second half of the year. Stifel points to NVIDIA’s expansion in the UAE and Saudi Arabia as contributing factors, despite challenges from the H20 restrictions. NVIDIA is also planning to launch a new, lower-priced AI chipset in China, expected to enter mass production by June. This new chipset, part of NVIDIA’s Blackwell-architecture AI processors, will be priced between $6,500 and $8,000, offering a more affordable option compared to its H20 model.

NVDA,2025-05-27,09:41,"Lynx: Risk priced in, Nvidia could surprise to the upside By Investing.com","Investing.com -- Nvidia stock could break out to new highs following its earnings report, according to Lynx Equity, which has raised its price target from $140 to $160.

“After a couple of quarters of inline results, we think NVDA has the potential to provide upside to muted investor expectations,” the firm wrote in a new note.

Lynx, which had previously highlighted concerns such as heating issues with the GB300 GPU and tariff exposure, now sees many risks as “priced in.”

The analysts credited Nvidia’s ability to “steamroll through” challenges ranging from delayed product launches and trade restrictions to grid limitations and scaling constraints.

They cited new growth vectors and capacity expansion as reasons for optimism.

“GB200 has overcome its teething issues,” Lynx said, pointing to a sharp ramp-up in production at Foxconn (SS: ) and a $500 million new manufacturing campus in Texas. Additionally, a resurgence in CoWoS capacity build at TSMC signals recovery in Nvidia’s supply chain.

Lynx also highlighted Nvidia’s “stealth entry” into Edge AI through its partnership with MediaTek, calling it a significant long-term opportunity, particularly in automotive and enterprise markets.

Tariff risks appear largely mitigated, according to the firm. “NVDA has in place a carefully crafted strategy to avoid nearly all tariffs,” Lynx said, noting recent exemptions from the U.S. Commerce Department and Nvidia’s diversified manufacturing footprint.

Lynx also pointed to “mega deals” such as the $500 billion Stargate project and new funding for AI clients like OpenAI and CoreWeave as likely to support future revenue growth.

“NVDA is on the verge of breaking out of the range and is headed for new highs,” Lynx concluded, maintaining a bullish stance into the earnings release.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/lynx-risk-priced-in-nvidia-could-surprise-to-the-upside-4065322

NVDA,2025-05-27,05:24,US stocks end sharply higher on Trump’s tariff reprieve By Reuters,"By Stephen Culp

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Wall Street surged on Tuesday as investor risk appetite was buoyed by U.S. President Donald Trump’s latest tariff respite and an unexpected jump in consumer confidence.

A broad rally sent all three major U.S. stock indexes higher, with strength in the AI-related ""magnificent seven"" group of momentum stocks putting the tech-laden Nasdaq out front.

The is now within 3.6% of its record closing high reached on February 19, having plunged as much as 18.9% below that level in the wake of Donald Trump’s erratic tariff announcements, which have whipsawed markets for much of the President’s second term.

""When (Trump) came out with guns blazing April 2, the market thought the world was ending,"" said Paul Nolte, senior wealth adviser and market strategist at Murphy and Sylvest in Elmhurst, Illinois. ""The selloff was so strong and quick that you would expect some rebound, and the rebound has been so sharp and quick that you would expect some type of pullback as investors digest it and ask themselves what the terrain really looks like.""

In the latest move, the president backed down from his 50% tariff threat against the European Union, delaying its implementation until July 9 to allow for negotiations between the White House and the 27-nation bloc. The move prompted Brussels to prepare for trade negotiations.

""Investors have kind of figured Trump out a little bit,"" Nolte added. ""He’s like the poker player at the table that you know is making some bets and then when pressed by the other players at the table, he folds.""

On the economic front, a 14.4% surge in current-month consumer confidence added momentum to the rally, helping investors look past a steeper-than-expected drop in new orders for core capital goods, considered a barometer of U.S. corporate spending plans.

Richmond Federal Reserve President Thomas Barkin told Bloomberg that economic data has yet to show increased price pressure or joblessness, echoing the sentiments of many Fed officials who anticipate the key interest rate will remain unchanged until the full effect of Trump’s tariffs is known.

Minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s most recent monetary policy meeting are due on Wednesday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global shares rose on Tuesday, buoyed by signs of easing trade tensions, even as longer-dated U.S. Treasury yields were set for their biggest one-day drop in more than a month.

U.S. President Donald Trump paused his threatened tariffs until July 9 on U.S. imports of European goods following a weekend call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

Data showed on Tuesday that U.S. consumer confidence snapped five straight months of decline and improved in May amid a truce in the trade war between Washington and Beijing.

All three Wall Street indexes finished higher, with the benchmark and Nasdaq adding more than 2% following Monday’s Memorial Day holiday. The S&P 500’s 11 subsectors all gained, led by consumer discretionary and technology stocks.

European shares rose 0.33%, with the defence subindex reaching a record high.

UK shares climbed 0.69% following a holiday at the start of the week. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe rose 1.21% to 880.84.

""We are seeing a relief rally as more and more there’s confirmation that all this (tariff threat) basically is negotiation tactics that have real teeth although not a bluff, meaning that Trump is not trying to drive us over the cliff but he’s taken us to the edge,"" said Daniel Genter, president and chief investment officer at Genter Capital Management in Los Angeles.

""I think people are getting more confident that we are not going to have massive tariffs that are going to significantly interrupt the U.S. economy or business flow, and have a reversal of modest GDP growth.""

The yield on 30-year U.S. Treasuries fell 8 basis points to 4.9572%, on track for the biggest one-day decline since mid-April.

The 30-year yields - at the epicentre of the market selloff in April following Trump’s initial raft of tariffs - are still just below 5%, near their highest since October 2023.

The move mirrored a near-20-basis-point fall in yields for Japanese 30-year debt that came after a Reuters report on Tuesday that Tokyo will consider trimming issuance of the super-long bonds, after recent sharp rises in yields.

""It was good news over the weekend, at least for the market, with the 30-day extra time frame for the EU trade tariff negotiation deadline. I guess the market was happy about that,"" said Wasif Latif, chief investment officer at Sarmaya Partners in New Jersey.

""Then the Bank of Japan said it was not going to issue as many bonds and so the yield story looked a little bit better.""

Investors will focus on results from Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) on Wednesday, with the chipmaker expected to report a 66% jump in first-quarter revenue.

Speeches from a slew of Federal Reserve policymakers and Friday’s U.S. core PCE price index are also due, which could provide clues on the outlook for U.S. rates.

The U.S. dollar advanced against major peers including the yen, euro and Swiss franc following the decision of the Japanese authorities to curb bond issuance and improvement in U.S. consumer confidence.

The dollar strengthened 1.09% to 144.39 against the Japanese yen. Against the Swiss franc, the dollar strengthened 0.82% to 0.82745. The euro was down 0.51% at $1.132725.

The , which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies including the yen and the euro,rose 0.66% to 99.608.

Gold prices fell as the U.S. dollar advanced. dropped 1.15% to $3,304.52 an ounce. U.S. settled 1.9% lower at $3,300.40.

Oil prices eased, spurred by worries of a supply glut after Iranian and U.S. delegations made progress on their talks and on expectations that OPEC+ will decide to increase output at a meeting later this week.

futures closed down 1% at $64.09 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude fell around 1.04% to $60.89 a barrel.

NVDA,2025-05-26,19:58,"Stock market today: S&P 500 rallies on consumer confidence, Trump EU tariff delay By Investing.com","Investing.com-- The S&P 500 rose sharply Tuesday after U.S. consumer confidence rebounded following a five-month slump, cooling fears about the economy just days after President President Donald Trump postponed plans to impose steep trade tariffs on the European Union.

At 4:00 p.m. ET (20:00 GMT), the rose 740 points, or 1.8%, the index gained 2.1%, and the advanced 2.5%.

Wall Street was closed on Monday on account of the Memorial Day holiday.

Consumer confidence jumps by the most in four years

Consumer confidence saw a strong rebound in May, ending a five-month decline, largely driven by renewed optimism surrounding economic conditions and boosted further by the U.S.-China trade deal announced mid-month.

According to The Conference Board, the Consumer Confidence Index surged 12.3 points to 98.0, surpassing expectations of just 87.1. The sharp rise was fueled by improvements in both consumers’ short-term outlook—reflected in the Expectations Index jumping 17.4 points to 72.8—and perceptions of current conditions, with the Present Situation Index up 4.8 points to 135.9.

Senior Economist Stephanie Guichard noted that confidence was already improving ahead of the trade deal but accelerated in its aftermath, highlighting the deal’s positive impact on consumer sentiment.

Tech rallies as Nvidia (NASDAQ: )’s earnings loom large; Tesla (NASDAQ: ), Coreweave jump

Big tech stocks led market higher, with Nvidia rising more than 3% ahead of its quarterly results due Wednesday after the market closes.

The company is considered a bellwether for global AI demand, especially in the chipmaking sector, and is sitting on a massive valuation spike over the past two years on this position.

Nvidia is expected to report bumper earnings, especially as Wall Street’s so-called AI Hyperscalers– its biggest customers– continued to spend heavily on AI over the past three months.

Elsewhere, Southwest Airlines (NYSE: ) stock rose after the carrier announced it will charge customers $35 for one checked bag and $45 for the second, bringing an end to its free luggage policy.

Salesforce (NYSE: ) stock gained after the Wall Street Journal reported that the software company is nearing an agreement to acquire Informatica in a deal valued at approximately $8 billion.

The quarterly earnings season is largely at an end, with more than 95% of companies having already reported, with almost 78% having surpassed analyst expectations, according to FactSet.

Numbers from IT service management company Okta (NASDAQ: ) are due after the bell Tuesday.

Elsewhere, Tesla climbed more than 6% after CEO Elon Musk said he would be ""super focused on /xAI and Tesla (plus Starship launch next week), as we have critical technologies rolling out.”

The remarks helped further restore confidence in Musk’s leadership amid concerns that his role within the Trump administration was taking too much of his focus.

CoreWeave Inc (NASDAQ: ) rose more than 20%, shrugging off a downgrade from Barclays to equalweight, citing concerns about limited short-term upside given the stock’s post-IPO run up.

Trump postpones 50% EU tariffs to July

Sentiment received a boost after Trump stated late Sunday that he had agreed to postpone his recently proposed 50% tariffs on goods from the EU to July 9, following a call with EU President Ursula von der Leyen.

Trump also said that his administration will begin trade talks in earnest with the EU, while Von Der Leyen also flagged improving relations with Washington.

The development offered some relief to markets, which were rattled on Friday by Trump threatening steep tariffs on the EU, along with Apple (NASDAQ: ).

This resulted in a losing week on Wall Street, with all three major indices falling more than 2% over the course of last week.

The July 9 deadline is also around when Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs are set to take effect, and the market’s remain focused on whether major U.S. trading partners can clinch agreements with Washington before the deadline.

More Fed speeches due

The U.S. president’s latest U-turn on EU tariffs reinforces how unpredictable his trade policies can be and undermines already fragile investor confidence in the U.S. economy.

An illustration of this uncertainty came with the orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods, which slumped in April, falling after the previous month’s sharp gains.

Orders for –items designed to last three years or more–fell 6.3% last month after a hefty revised 7.6% gain in March, the Commerce Department’s Census Bureau said on Tuesday.

Transportation equipment, down following four consecutive monthly increases, drove the decrease, falling $20.3 billion or 17.1 percent to $98.8 billion.

Minneapolis Federal Reserve President on Tuesday continued to call for a pause rates until there was more uncertainty on the tariff impact.

Investors are also likely Tuesday to carefully study commentary from Fed Governor Christopher Waller and New York Fed President and adding to a series of comments from their colleagues last week.

John Hutchison, Executive Director, JPMorgan’s Investment Bank: Hi, everybody. I’m John Hutchison, executive director from JPMorgan’s Investment Bank, Here to introduce Ryan Steelberg, the co founder, CEO and Chairman of Veritone. Veritone was started in 2014, about eleven years ago. Ryan started it with his brother. And Ryan has since grown the business to $100,000,000 IPO ed the business and overseen the execution for the past eleven years.

Ryan has twenty five years of experience in executive management across media companies, tech companies, including divisional head divisional leadership at Google (NASDAQ: ). And Ryan is based out of Orange County and a native of Orange County alumni of UCLA. So Ryan, first, why don’t you tell us a little bit about your story building Veritone and introduce the audience to yourself.

Ryan Steelberg, Co-founder, CEO and Chairman, Veritone: Well, thank you. For everybody online, nice to have an opportunity to talk to you today. My journey started and it’s kind of the journey of Veritone in the mid ninety’s. So one of the sort of first pioneers to build one of the big first ad tech companies called Adforce right out of school. Built that up to be, again, one of it was pretty much Adforce and DoubleClick that kind of led and pioneered the way for all ad delivery on the web.

Built that business up through its IPO in the late ’90s. And we’ve had a lot of successes building and running, I’ll say, tech enabled advertising technology businesses over the course of my career. I think the one thing that we learned, and I think it’s one of the reasons why in the disciplines of AI you really see, I think, two big split in threads of where you saw so much innovation come from. One was e commerce. We’ll call the Peter Thiel and Elon Musk path.

And then you’ll see the ad tech side, right, primarily Google and that side. And there’s a reason for that. Why that history is important is running AI at scale is very challenging. It’s a massive data problem. And ad technology and ad serving is a major technology data problem.

You need to be able to and I’ll do the parallel real quick. If you’re going back and you go through the history of going from serving tons of ads on legacy data centers to now migration to the cloud and then the mobile phone comes out and then you go from websites to search, What the common thread is tons and tons of data, ad requests, billions and billions per hour and you have to figure out to serve the right ad to the right person at the right time. So fundamentally, the leveraging and invoking neural networks, rudimentary AI based models was almost a prerequisite to continue to advance when the sheer volume of ad delivery exploded around the world. And then a whole another phenomena happened. And this was really the onset of the mobile device where video and audio exploded.

So for many, many years, almost everything we were doing originally was very structured. HTML is very structured, meaning think of it as structured data versus unstructured data. Common theme that we’re going be talking about a lot. I’m sure many, many people across this conference are going to be talking about it. But the fastest growing data set was unstructured data.

So think of it this way. I have somebody who’s watching, who’s online and they’re no longer just reading a written article and looking at a few pictures, but they’re spending 90% of the time full screen watching a video. Well, if you’re Google and others and us ad tech guys, that’s both an opportunity but very scary. Where am I going serve ads? Right?

So there became a strong interest leveraging, again, rudimentary cognitive based AI, and this goes back almost twenty years, is we need to start figuring out what’s inside this content and we need to do it at scale, number one. And number two is we need to start having a much better understanding of contextual based targeting. Right? So I’m not just serving an ad and trying to build an inference model about who you are when you’re logging on, but also I need to figure out and do the parallel between who you are and what you’re looking at and what your interests are. Was very challenging, legacy algorithm of the processes and models weren’t working.

And so that’s where you start to really see the emergence and investment heavy in AI. Obviously, Google, when I sold my last successful business to Google in 02/2008, was I was tasked primarily to go after the unstructured data market. How could they start to look at these huge corpuses of audio and video and how could we start to figure out how to monetize that at scale? So that was really the kernel of Veritone. So Veritone is an idea that frankly we were thinking about going back to right after we sold DMARC broadcasting to Google back in the day and we and thesis was this, and it holds true today and it’s been validated over and over, is wow, there’s a lot of unstructured data being created and this is the tip of the iceberg.

And just put it in perspective, 80% plus of all new data created every single day is unstructured, messy. Think of it as noise and harmonics off an energy grid. Think of it as audio and video, right, being produced. When I say unstructured is it’s hard for rudimentary machines to understand that data without actually adding doing a lot of work to the data first. So you have to actually it’s like mining ore.

But again, if you can figure out how to mine ore effectively, there’s going to be tremendous value there. So Veritone was the idea as a play on words, means truth in the signal, is we believe we could create something very meaningful and impactful that if we could build a system that could ingest huge amounts of unstructured data, primarily audio and video, that will be a common theme throughout this talk. And I could leverage both cognitive science and obviously today future, I’ll say more advanced AI models, large language models, etcetera. But back then when we started this, we were really having to deal with AI based models we were creating ourselves that were, I would say, more rudimentary cognitive models. These are transcription, translation, object detection, face detection.

In no way are we minimizing those, but when you are dealing with tens of thousands of hours a minute, and our volume today, we process well over one hundred thousand hours of audio and video every single day for our customers, the volume is astronomical. And fundamentally you have to be able to, a, be able to figure out how to ingest and store and index all these huge amounts of unstructured data before we can even do anything with it. Number two is do we have the right cost effective AI models that can extract enough of intelligent data from it so we can act upon it? So here’s the best way and I’ll speed up. We don’t need to go through the rest of the history.

But this is now 2012, we have this idea. The original idea of Veritone was purely for media and entertainment. Right? How can we help extend this technology base to the big media companies, the big advertising companies out there to extend? But right even before we sort of launched our first prototype, which our platform is called aiWARE, which is a key point in our technology stack, we knew that this was much bigger than just tracking advertising, right, and facilitating advertising.

So I think what I’ll do is I’ll give you two examples end to end of like a customer to sort of explain exactly what we do in the commercial sense. And then obviously over the years now we’ve expanded, which we’re very excited about, into the public sector and other areas where there also is a huge need for understanding leveraging unstructured data. So ESPN. Kind of a prototypical customer of ours on the media and entertainment side. We have mostly large enterprise customers as our accounts and they range again on the commercial from large dozens and hundreds of media entertainment customers from movie studios to broadcasters, audio groups and video based groups.

But let’s take ESPN and Disney (NYSE: ). So for ESPN, who’s been a customer now for about seven years, they keep renewing and they keep expanding, we are their kind of primary AI back end system. And what we do for them is we, every day, ingest every piece of content that they produce, obviously starting with a lot of their historical archive and that includes everything you hear over audio, podcasting, their video, the actual linear broadcast programming and all the components that go into that. So think of this huge amount of tonnage that comes into it. ESPN’s job and they do create some of their own singular shows, but for the most part they are an aggregator.

They’re having to collect hundreds of thousands of different sports clips around the world, be able to ingest, understand those quickly, and ultimately you and I, we see the very end product which is SportsCenter, right, that comes out every four. That takes a lot of work. Now, obviously with many different platforms for distribution, mobile, social, etc, their job, their speed and the time that they have to ingest, index, organize, package and repush out is incredibly high and it’s very expensive. When we first started working with them, they had well over 500 interns literally manually labeling content, trying to collect sources. Obviously, I think we’ve completely automated that whole process for them over the years.

So now the new world is all that content is being ingested into an instance of aiWARE for ESPN, whereas their system of record, we’re ingesting all that content, we’re indexing it in near real time, and think of it as just layers and so tonnage, so just visually think of it as creating a huge data lake first and then applying the right AI models to extract that value has multiple layers. So you you don’t want to trivialize part the first result. You got a question?

John Hutchison, Executive Director, JPMorgan’s Investment Bank: Yeah, yeah. And so from a viewer experience standpoint, that’s when they call up a clip from ten years ago, that’s because it got tagged by Veritone and they’re able to pull it up quickly.

Ryan Steelberg, Co-founder, CEO and Chairman, Veritone: One of many. The use cases I’ll get to, but before you get to the plethora of different use cases, you have to go through the page of ingestion, index, organize. It’s like creating the Google search corpus before anybody even starts to search for it. But yes, so now once you’ve done this full indexing, the opportunities and I’ll really focus on three main personas, the end user, where is this value being derived from, really falls into research, programming, advertising and sponsorship. And then obviously you’re going all the way to B2B2C, the end consumer obviously is the final beneficiary of this.

But now you can start doing really amazing things in near real time is pull me up all footage where Tiger Woods is on screen, his face, there’s a Nike (NYSE: ) logo in the background and in an aperture of five minutes they’re talking about redemption from a car accident to winning the US Open. And by the way, what I just described, you know, up until the exciting inclusion of large language models into our stack is it was still efficient, but it was like boolean, your classic search. Now, obviously, you can do it organically. So what I just described seems like, wow, that’s amazing. It’s like a truly search engine for the unbelievable amount of corpus of audio video.

You’re right. But that’s just but what’s come and been derived from that is all now it’s been seamlessly integrated into their workflow. So they know why which programming is working and what’s not. They’ve now done the correlation to Nielsen ratings. They’ve now done all the integrations working with us to first party data for consumption.

So they know what’s working and what’s not working. They know that that host that they signed a $100,000,000 contract with five years ago, his ratings are declining. And now you can actually have that layer of understanding in that data to prove and support your decisions when you’re trying to figure out new programming ideas. The advertising side just is probably the thing that helps fund this whole project is because so much advertising is now, as we all experience, particularly in sports, is embedded inside the content, we now have complete visibility and resolution of the efficacy of those ads. Meaning, obviously we’re in Boston right now, right?

The Celtics somehow won last night. I’m from LA, so I can do a little pun there. But if you watch that game, you’re seeing advertising embedded all throughout the broadcast. It’s not a commercial break anymore, it’s literally organic. When there’s a time out, we all heard it, they’re saying this time out is sponsored by GEICO and there’s a GEICO logo in the background.

Because of AI now, that’s indexed, we can now understand how valuable and how effective embedded organic advertising is, native based ads, in contrast or in correlation with a classic commercial break. So that’s just another big example. What we’re finding so exciting is once you’ve created this huge corpus of intelligence from this unstructured data, every company is now taking it in some different direction. So, again, we work with CNBC, CNN, the Disney’s, almost every audio broadcaster out there has been clients for years. And so I think we’ve created a great sustainable and growing business in the media entertainment and commercial space.

And I’ll just give you a metric and then I’ll open it up for a few questions before we go over to public sector. But scale wise, on behalf of our customers, we indexed and processed almost 60,000,000 of audio video last year. And that’s like almost 11 petabytes of data. It’s huge. Massive scale.

So much scale that we are platform agnostic. So we run all of aiWARE and our payloads on AWS, on Azure. We’re completely platform agnostic. That has multiple benefits, but also by the nature of how we’ve designed this platform, our customers, let’s say who are big Azure or AWS customers, they can actually knock off or use this platform against their commitments and their credits. So anyway, that’s kind of the back story how we got here.

It started with an ad tech vision, expanded. We are now I’d say, who is Veritone? We are the experts on large scale audio and video indexing and understanding with AI. Period. I don’t think there’s any company that’s better than audio and video understanding and leveraging the opportunities for that than Veritone is.

That’s really who we are to our DNA.

John Hutchison, Executive Director, JPMorgan’s Investment Bank: Great. Thanks, Ryan. Bringing things up to speed in terms of a business update. Over the past few years Veritone has gone through a transition culminating in the sale of the legacy non software business Veritone One. So can you tell us about that evolution just in the past couple of years?

Is Veritone through the transition to becoming the pure play AI company?

Ryan Steelberg, Co-founder, CEO and Chairman, Veritone: Well, went through I’d say we started out as pure AI, pure play, and then we went through a journey and we’re kind of coming back to our roots as the markets matured. You know, I’ve done this, this is my sixth company and timing is everything at times. When we first launched this, we took this company public for some various reasons very early when we were doing, frankly, like $10,000,000 of revenue because we could, right? We were able to raise a tremendous amount of money. And my vision when we first and our vision when we first launched Veritone was we really didn’t want to build end solutions or applications.

We wanted to build this large infrastructure called aiWARE, publish our APIs and just wait for the business to flow in and we would index all of Disney’s content and that was going be more like a Twilio (NYSE: ), if you will, back in the day. But back in 2012 through February early days of the founding of the company, the industry wasn’t ready. They weren’t ready with their data sets. By the way, if the companies or my clients don’t really understand their data sets at all, or frankly a lot of their data sets are not even in proper digital form, What do I I need gas to run my engine. So we had to do a pivot for the first few years, I would say from 2018 through the early 20s, ’20 ’20, ’20 ’20 ’2, where we had to go build the actual end applications.

So meaning instead of ESPN giving them a bunch of unmined ore, we had to do a lot of work. And so meaning what people are buying from us, that’s running on aiWARE, but we had to build the end applications. So I’ll make a rough analogy. We were building Windows and instead of people building applications on Windows, we initially, because the industry was not quite there yet, we had to go build Office, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ). And that’s what we’ve been selling.

So the majority of our revenue today, about 60,000,000 of it, is from the end applications built on our stack which everything I told you, all the ingredients, all the cool AI, what turns into value and discernible ROI for end customers is the application layer. Obviously, thankfully we had enough subject matter expertise to make that pivot. The other thing was in our history, just because of our background and other reasons, we were and we did raise a lot of money. Even with our experience and I’d say a few failures in the past and a lot of success, We kind of broke the cardinal sin of we started waiting for the market to mature with shareholders. We started spending money and we got distracted.

We kind of applied our technology stack into a lot of different other areas. We were in the energy grid optimization business for a while, literally trying to optimize solar and battery utilization with our stack. And because we could. We were kind of waiting and their budgets were really not flowing. Bottom line is that we spent a lot of stuff and got distracted.

And so, unfortunately, when the true bomb dropped in this industry, was the release of ChatGBT, and the whole world woke up and said, let’s go. Thankfully I enough of a stable business, which I’ve just been describing on the commercial side, and the emergence of our public safety side, but we were not unfortunately in a position to sprint and capitalize on. That was a mistake we made. We spent too much money. We then raised debt.

And so, unfortunately with, in my mind, the perfect stack that was ready to go and get us into hyper growth velocity, I was cleaning house. I was a private equity CEO trying to manage downsizing when I should be investing in going for hyperbolic growth. So that process of me, I’ll say, trying to clean up the business and get us back to, frankly, our roots has taken about two years. So I do believe we’re through the valley. One of those which you just described is we did at one time own a traditional media agency, like an ad agency.

It was a big one. It was called Veritone One and we finally offloaded it at the end of next year. It was powered, so what differentiated that advertising agency was our technology, but it was a service business. It wasn’t we weren’t selling the core product was not AI were our applications. It was this third party services group.

And that was, I would say, it was one of the few major strategic moves that I needed to make to get us back to where we are today where I’m pure play AI. This is what I do. I ingest unstructured data, I turn it into value, I sell applications and I think we’re there, which is exciting.

John Hutchison, Executive Director, JPMorgan’s Investment Bank: That’s great. Jumping into what I think is the most exciting question today, Veritone Data Refinery was announced in November of twenty twenty four and is an exciting new growth driver for the company, already driving about $10,000,000 in pipeline. With premium data becoming more valuable for training AI models, we think it’s going be a $17,000,000,000 market in the next five to seven years. VDR is positioned to deliver a huge amount of growth for the company to help monetize customers’ content in a whole new way. So, can you tell us a little bit about VDR?

Ryan Steelberg, Co-founder, CEO and Chairman, Veritone: Yeah. So, the workflow and ecosystem of AI, training data is lifeblood. Right? Before you can run these models against new data sets, like running transcription and so on, you have to actually build the models. Building these models takes training data and lots of it.

And it’s exponentially growing the demand for training data. It took a whole another level when you introduced large language models and now multimodal models, meaning models that can understand and discern audio and video and other things in a common model. There’s been a few companies over the years that have emerged to assist in the preparation of training data. And it’s something that we’ve been looking at for a few years now. One is a private entity called Scale AI, which you may have heard of.

Just to put in perspective how important preparing data is, the CEO of Scale was actually with the president in The Middle East. Just perspective. You’re seeing Coke and you’re seeing Jensen and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Elon Musk, but then there’s somebody there who prepares the data, literally. And it’s not just pure technology, it’s Mechanical Turk human labeling company, which is a big portion of the revenue. That’s how important data is.

And it’s an insatiable amount. You mentioned $17,000,000,000 it couldn’t even surpass that. So what we looked at was how can Veritone, because we’ve been now for over a decade ingesting and amassing the largest corpus of clean audio and video, this might be a big opportunity for us. What made us made the decision to open up this organic new line of business was Shutterstock (NYSE: ). Shutterstock, a public company recently being, I think, taking private and consolidating with Getty.

But Shutterstock, who is one of the largest stock photo businesses out there, they entered that space, meaning they started to mobilize and license and work with the These are the Google Geminis, these are the OpenAI’s. They started to license their imagery to these groups to help them train their models. We were watching this very closely since obviously we’re sitting on a tremendous amount of audio and video. And then when we saw their growth, that really went from like zero to over $130,000,000 in just a few years in their data services business, it was when we started to craft our idea really in the beginning, like second quarter of last year was when we said, hey, let’s really look at what the efficacy of this business line expansion for Veritone.

So obviously fast forward a little bit, we designed and took to market VDR, Veritone Data Refinery, and we kind of came to market in mid Q4, so it’s only been a few months. And the reception has been incredible. So we are we think that this is going to be one of the largest lines of business for Veritone for the next several years. We are actively booking business. We’re generating material revenue.

Contracts are 6 figures and higher that we’re working with. And specifically, again, is we are working on both sides of the equation. We’re on one side, if you will, representing and working with our customers who we’ve had customers for ten years in some instances, not just large media companies, but I’ll just say other entities that have large corpuses of unstructured audio and video, including surveillance video, which we’ll talk about public sector in a second. But we’re now ingesting, we’re preparing that data, ironically using AI to prepare the data to train other AI. Right?

It’s a really interesting virtuous cycle. But no, we’re engaged with all the main buyers and we do think that we thought that this was going to be a few million dollars of contribution. I think it’s going to be significantly more than that in calendar year 2025 and beyond. And I think we’re we’ve got some interesting moats around us. I mean scale is a big one.

And I’ll give you just a couple of examples. We’re not just limited to facilitating the data sets that we already have under representation. It gives us a huge competitive advantage that we do with the groups like the NCAA and others that have these huge libraries. However, we are also being tasked and working with the model development companies, the hyperscalers, who are giving us tasks on their side. They’re telling us under contract with them to go find new data sets, help us prepare it.

So, if you want to think about it is Veritone is the audio and video version of Scale AI. Right? And that’s a very, very exciting opportunity for us. I’ve seen lightning in a bottle a few times and this could be one of them. Even if it’s not lightning, it’s going to be producing a lot of revenue ore for us which is exciting.

John Hutchison, Executive Director, JPMorgan’s Investment Bank: That’s terrific. Jumping into public sector, you’ve alluded to several times now. Veritone has made great strides in the public sector with some large wins with the DOD, DOJ. What are some of the problems that you’re solving for the public sector and how are you competing with how are you taking on competitors who are also trying to dig into the space? So

Ryan Steelberg, Co-founder, CEO and Chairman, Veritone: reflecting on the commercial side with media and entertainment customers, it’s interesting. Their core business is leveraging the audio and video they produce and making money. The core asset that we act upon is their core product offering. So meaning media entertainment customers have triple PhDs, if you will, on the format of audio and video. Even before cloud and going back cold storage and tape and etcetera.

So meaning we’ve proven there was a huge problem, we’ve generated a nice business from helping them mobilize and advance for media entertainment customers. Meaning, now imagine you look at almost every other company whose core expertise is not managing their data. It’s not their core product offering. If you look at state and local law enforcement, I’ll look at two groups, the Department of Defense and certain agencies like the Air Force or state and local law enforcement. These are entities now that are being bombarded with having to, again, understand and leverage tons and tons of data to run their business.

If you are Beverly Hills to Police Department, a client of ours, and you are involved in a case or investigation, this is no longer beat cops going out and talking to people and taking manual notes and stuff. This is now a massive data collection. We know the one we’ve all celebrated now and it took years to really understand is DNA. Imagine doing cases now without DNA. By the way, DNA was probably one of the most unstructured things that you could figure out or try to understand.

It took years to have any credibility before it even was acceptable in cases. Now, in fact, it’s considered as ground truth ironically, even more than eyewitnesses at times, as you know. So, if you are let’s go very practical. There is a homicide or there’s a domestic violence incident. Every investigation has to start collecting evidence.

The fastest new form of evidence is audio and video. Body cameras, dash cams, security cameras. And obviously we like to say crime travels. Something bad happens, the person flees. We call it Jason Bourne.

They’re running across it. You have to collect this information, you have to build a case. The Boston bombing, we’re here. It took literally thousands and thousands of people, they rented out warehouses and sifted through the stuff manually. But imagine and that’s unlimited budget with the FBI.

Imagine now you have to do that in a case where it’s citizen upload video. So we have applied Veritone and aiWARE technology very similar to what we do for audio and video for ESPN, but now we’re ingesting and integrating and harvesting all those disparate data sets to help accelerate investigations. And there’s many different layers of this and it’s so exciting. But again, ultimately we want to help them close cases faster, which is time savings because I don’t care where you are and what your position is, but all these budgets are being constrained for law enforcement. And then there’s all these residual applications or use cases that popped up like FOIA requests, Freedom of Information Act.

So when you see footage show up and it’s being redacted, so it’s not just using our technology to find the bad guy, it’s also protecting, say, the identity of citizens. They have to release that footage to the public. It’s called FOIA, Freedom of Information Act, where that information has to get released to the public. We need protect people. So we use our AI to obfuscate their faces and change their voices.

And that’s what you see when those video clips pop up on the news and stuff like that. So public sector is a very, very exciting business for us. We’re at I just described in kind of that micro use case for staying local is the same applications at a much bigger scale which we’re doing the DOJ and the Department of Defense. So we’re actively working with the Air Force. We’re actively working with the Department of Defense Logistics Agency.

It’s taken us a very long time to get in this space. Getting into the Fed I mean FedRAMP and having your authorization to operate takes years. But I think successfully we’re there and you’re going to see 2025 is going to be not just the year of VDR. Twenty twenty five is going to be the year where Veritone sort of breaks into a new electron level for public sector growth as well.

John Hutchison, Executive Director, JPMorgan’s Investment Bank: Any questions from the audience in our last few minutes here? All right. A couple more from me. You mentioned these great, really exciting growth vectors in public sector and the VDR product. What are a couple of things you wish the market better understood about Veritone in the story?

Ryan Steelberg, Co-founder, CEO and Chairman, Veritone: You know, we’ve been around for a while. I think it’s probably here’s the core pillars. One is Veritone probably has the largest number of enterprise core AI customers outside of the hyperscalers. We have thousands of customers that use our core AI platform and applications every single day. We have tens of thousands of end users that use our applications.

So our solutions are mission critical to the missions for these commercial businesses as well as the public sector. So I would say when you dig in, the more interesting and exciting it is. So there’s real meat there. The testament and the proof point there is our retention rate is very high, high at the 90 percentile. And many of the companies I mentioned before The NCAA, I think, just signed five plus three year deal.

Right? I mean, these huge extensions. So we are here to stay and we’re experts at this. So, thankfully, we’ve done a good job of being, I’d say, strategic and fiscal stewards to get the business back in shape, right, back to our roots. But here’s the second thing I want people to know is through that journey of cleaning up the business, we did not get rid of any of our core assets, not one.

Our core lines of business, we kept all of them. So I think people are this is really an entry point. I think, frankly, we are probably the most undervalued stock on all NASDAQ, bar none, right, relative to it. And I think that will change very, very quickly. Hopefully it shouldn’t take one big announcement with a new big DoD customer.

It shouldn’t. But again, we have to prove ourselves. At the end of the day, it’s a numbers game. We shouldn’t be a story stock. But again, I just think once we get back into the light, you know, for over a thousand days our stock was over $20 right, going back years.

So we should be at a different point. You know, I think some were strategic moves we made, right, poorly in the past. But we’re through that and now it’s just, hey, take a look at Veritone because if you’re looking for AI quote unquote exposure, this hasn’t been a diamond in the rough. It’s been a diamond that’s kind of been under a cloth here for a while. And it’s still there and people are going see some amazing things this year from us.

John Hutchison, Executive Director, JPMorgan’s Investment Bank: Wonderful. Thank you, Ryan, for joining us today here in Boston at the JPMorgan TMC Conference.

Ryan Steelberg, Co-founder, CEO and Chairman, Veritone: Thank you. Thank you.

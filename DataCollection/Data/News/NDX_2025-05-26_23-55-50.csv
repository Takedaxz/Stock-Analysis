Trump agrees to postpone 50% EU tariffs to July

Trump said in a social media post that he had a productive call with EU head Ursula Von Der Leyen, and had agreed to postpone his proposed 50% levies on the bloc to July 9.

Trump said trade talks with the EU were set to begin in earnest immediately, while EU head Von Der Leyen also flagged improving relations with Washington.

Trump had on Friday threatened to impose 50% tariffs on the EU due to what he saw as a lack of progress in trade talks with the bloc. Separately, Trump had also threatened to impose 25% tariffs on Apple (NASDAQ: ) Inc’s imported iPhones, as well as any other smartphone.

Nvidia Q1 earnings on tap, AI demand, China, in focus

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: ) is set to report its fiscal first-quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday, with focus squarely on whether the AI-fuelled demand boost it received over the past two years remained in play.

The company had recently flagged some headwinds for its China sales, especially after the Trump administration introduced even tighter curbs on chip sales to the country.

But outsized AI demand through the first quarter is expected to have boosted Nvidia’s earnings despite difficulties in China, especially as its biggest customers– Wall Street’s so-called AI hyperscalers– continued spending vast amounts of money on the technology this year.

Reuters reported over the weekend that Nvidia planned to sell a cheaper, lower-spec AI chip from its Blackwell line in China later this year.

NDX,2025-05-23,17:48,US regulators greenlight construction of Venture Global CP2 LNG plant in Louisiana By Reuters,"By Curtis Williams

HOUSTON (Reuters) -U.S. regulators have given Venture Global permission to proceed with construction of its CP2 liquefied (LNG) plant in Louisiana, a FERC document showed on Friday.

If constructed, CP2 will be the single largest LNG export facility in the U.S. and help the country remain the world’s largest exporter of the superchilled gas. It also could make Venture Global the largest U.S. LNG company.

The decision follows a final environmental study that shows the 28 million metric tons per annum plant is in the public interest.

Venture Global had obtained approval to construct the plant, but after a court ruling, FERC conducted an additional environmental review of the impact on air quality.

The study concluded that the project should be allowed to continue.

""Neither the presumptive stay ...nor the Commission’s regulations barring construction for a limited period pending rehearing will apply upon issuance of this order,"" federal regulators said.

With federal approvals in hand, the company will immediately launch on-site construction for the project, the company’s CEO Mike Sabel said on Friday.

The additional review followed an August 2024 decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that quashed FERC approval of rival LNG exporter NextDecade (NASDAQ: )’s plant at the Port of Brownsville, Texas. In light of the court ruling, FERC decided to review the CP2 project’s impact on air quality.

CP2 has been at the center of a fight between the energy sector and environmentalists seeking to limit future LNG projects on the U.S. Gulf Coast.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-regulators-greenlights-construction-of-venture-global-cp2-lng-plant-in-louisiana-4062621

NDX,2025-05-23,07:37,Apple stock trades lower after Trump threatens 25% tariff By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) shares tumbled Friday following President Trump’s threat to impose a 25% tariff on the company’s products if they are not manufactured in the United States. The announcement also affected U.S. stocks, with the main indexes down 0.5% to 0.9%.

As of 12:55 PM ET, Apple shares are down 2.7%, dragging both the and lower.

The President expressed his demands on Truth Social, insisting that iPhones sold in the U.S. should be made domestically rather than abroad. ""I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone’s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else. If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"" Trump posted.

This development comes as Apple’s key contractor, Foxconn (SS: ), reportedly plans to invest $1.5 billion in a new facility in Tamil Nadu, India, to produce display modules for iPhones. The move is part of Apple’s strategy to diversify its supply chain, which currently extends to countries like Vietnam and Malaysia, with India becoming a significant focus of these efforts.

Despite the threats from Trump, analysts remain skeptical that Apple can produce iPhones in the U.S. anytime soon, and without the device’s price skyrocketing.

""The pressure from Trump Administration on Apple to build iPhone production in the US as we have discussed this would result in an iPhone price point that is a non-starter for Cupertino and translate into iPhone prices of ~$3,500 if it was made in the US which is not realistic as this would take 5-10 years to shift production to the US,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives commented following the news.

""We believe the concept of Apple producing iPhones in the US is a fairy tale that is not feasible,"" Ives added.

Meanwhile, UBS analyst David Vogt said that while the announcement creates headline risk for Apple, the actual impact of a blanket 25% tariff on U.S. iPhones is only a modest incremental EPS headwind.

""If a 25% blanket tariff is applied to ~70M annual iPhones imported into the US from China and India, we estimate the annual EPS headwind would be $0.51, only slightly worse than our prior expectation of $0.34 without any offsets,"" Vogt stated.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/apple-stock-falls-after-trump-threatens-25-tariff-4061806
NDX,2025-05-23,04:04,"U.S. federal spending: $100 a second for 2,248 years By Investing.com","Investing.com -- Investors pulled $4.1 billion from global equity funds in the week to May 21, ending an eight-week streak of inflows as capital rotated into bonds, cash and crypto, according to Bank of America (BofA).

Bond funds drew $25 billion, money markets added $16.1 billion, and crypto saw $2.3 billion of inflows. Gold, by contrast, lost $2.9 billion—the third-biggest weekly outflow ever.

Tech equities recorded a record $6.8 billion exit, mostly tied to the $6.7 billion liquidation of the leveraged FNGA ETF.

Investment-grade bonds led fixed-income flows with a $13.5 billion weekly gain, the strongest since September. High-yield bonds posted a fourth consecutive weekly inflow, totaling $1.9 billion, and $9.8 billion over four weeks—the most since November.

Emerging market (EM) debt inflows hit $1.7 billion, the best since January 2023, while Treasuries saw $5.1 billion return after recent outflows.

The note’s most arresting stat captures the scale of U.S. government spending. “If you spent $100 every second, it would take you 2248 years to equal the $7.1 trillion the U.S. government spent in the past year,” BofA strategists led by Michael Hartnett highlighted.

The strategists say this fiscal trajectory is unsustainable. Bond yields above 5%, they argue, are damaging to the highly “financialized” U.S. economy and bond vigilantes are now incentivized to punish the government’s failure to rein in debt and deficits.

Hartnett warns that above 5%—paired with a sub-100 dollar strength index (DXY)—remain negative for risk assets.

The report also points to a structural shift in markets as the “Anything but Bonds” trade takes hold. A 40-year bond bull market has reversed, driven by persistent inflation, tighter monetary policy, expansive fiscal spending, and protectionist industrial strategies—marking a clear break from the disinflationary era that long supported fixed income.

Regionally, U.S. equity funds saw $1.8 billion in outflows in the past week. Emerging markets lost $5.5 billion—their worst week in 14—and Japan posted a $4 billion exit. Europe remained resilient with $400 million in inflows.

NDX,2025-05-23,03:27,"Futures stabilize, Apple’s discounts, BYD outsells Tesla","Investing.com - U.S. stock futures stabilized Friday, but Wall Street was still on course for a losing week as debt concerns lifted Treasury yields. BYD (SZ: ) outsold Tesla in Europe for the first time, Apple is offering trade-in discounts in China, while a trade deal between the U.S. and the European Union still seems a far way off.

1. U.S. futures fall on elevated Treasury yields

U.S. stock futures steadied Friday after previous losses, with elevated U.S. Treasury yields weighing on sentiment as President Donald Trump’s tax bill makes its way through Congress.

At 03:20 ET (07:20 GMT), rose 40 points, or 0.1%, and traded 3 points, or 0.1%, higher, while slipped 3 points, or 0.1%.

All three indices are on pace for losses this week, with the broad-based down nearly 2%, the blue chip around 1.9% lower, and the tech-heavy set for a 1.5% drop.

The House of Representatives passed Trump’s tax and spending bill with only one vote to spare on Thursday, and it now goes to the Senate, where more heated debate is likely.

Republicans broadly agree on the main planks of the legislation, including the extension of Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, but there remains concerns that the measure does not sufficiently cut spending.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates it will add $3.8 trillion to the federal government’s $36.2 trillion in debt.

Worries about the cost of the measure – and its impact on the nation’s debt and deficit – sent long-term Treasury yields higher. The 30-year Treasury bond yield touched a high of 5.161%, its highest level since October 2023, while the 10-year Treasury note breached 4.6%.

2. BYD outsells Tesla in Europe for first time

Electric vehicle market leader Tesla (NASDAQ: ) received another blow Friday following the news that Chinese EV giant BYD outsold its U.S. rival for the first time in Europe.

A report from analytics firm JATO Dynamics said BYD registered 7,231 battery-powered vehicles in Europe in April, overtaking the 7,165 units registered by Tesla.

BYD’s sales also came despite the European Union imposing steep import tariffs on Chinese EVs last year.

“Although the difference between the two brands’ monthly sales totals may be small, the implications are enormous,” said Felipe Munoz, a global analyst at Jato Dynamics. “This is a watershed moment for Europe’s car market, particularly when you consider that Tesla has led the European BEV market for years, while BYD only officially began operations beyond Norway and the Netherlands in late 2022.”

Tesla is struggling with slowing sales across the globe, with the company logging its first ever drop in annual deliveries in 2024.

3. U.S.-EU trade deal still far away - FT

Equity markets globally received a boost with the trade deal between China and the U.S. earlier this month, but further good news in the form of an agreement between the European Union and Washington still looks far away.

U.S. trade negotiators are pushing the EU to make unilateral tariff reductions on U.S. goods, saying without concessions the bloc will not progress in talks to avoid additional 20% ""reciprocal"" duties, the Financial Times reported on Friday.

The FT added that the European Union has been pushing for a jointly agreed framework text for the talks but the two sides remain too far apart.

The U.S. imposed 25% tariffs on EU cars, steel and aluminium in March and 20% tariffs on other EU goods in April. It then halved the 20% rate until July 8, setting a 90-day window for talks to reach a more comprehensive tariff deal.

In response, the 27-nation EU suspended its own plans to impose retaliatory tariffs on some U.S. goods and proposed zero duties for all industrial goods on both sides.

4. Apple offers trade-in discounts in China

Apple (NASDAQ: ) is offering additional trade-in discounts for new iPhones in China until June 18, according to its website on Friday, in what appears to be the latest attempt by the tech giant to boost sales in this vital market.

Apple’s market share in China has shrunk significantly, falling from 15.6% in the first quarter of 2024 to 13.7% in the first quarter of this year, resulting in the U.S. company falling to fifth place in the Chinese smartphone market, behind Xiaomi (OTC: ), Huawei, Oppo, and Vivo.

This is a significant drop, as Apple was previously the market leader in China.

The company is also facing severe headwinds from high U.S. trade tariffs on China, which stand to severely increase the prices of its devices. Over 90% of Apple’s flagship iPhones are manufactured in China, while the country is also Apple’s largest market outside North America.

5. Crude set for weekly decline on supply pressures

Oil prices retreated Friday, on course for their first weekly decline in three weeks, weighed down by renewed supply pressure with OPEC+ considering another increase in production levels.

At 03:20 ET, futures dropped 0.7% to $63.99 a barrel, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 0.7% to $60.80 a barrel.

For the week, both benchmarks have fallen around 2%, falling to their lowest in more than one week, following two weeks of gains.

The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, collectively known as OPEC+, are weighing the possibility of another production boost at their upcoming meeting on June 1, Bloomberg News reported Thursday.

According to delegates cited in the report, one option under consideration is a supply increase of 411,000 barrels per day in July, though no final decision has been made.

The market is also closely watching U.S.-Iranian nuclear negotiations which could determine the future supply of Iranian oil. The fifth round of talks will take place in Rome later Friday.

NDX,2025-05-22,03:37,"Futures muted, Trump tax bill in focus, flash PMIs ahead","Investing.com - U.S. stock futures hovered around the flatline following a drop in equities and uptick in U.S. government bond yields in the prior session. Traders eye upcoming business activity data as well as a potential pre-dawn vote in the U.S. House of Representatives on President Donald Trump’s sweeping tax and spending bill. Meanwhile, OpenAI’s CEO reportedly aims to ship an artificial intelligence product in 2026.

1. Futures subdued

U.S. stock futures were muted on Thursday, pointing to a breather for markets after a sell-off in the prior session.

By 03:31 ET (07:31 GMT), the contract was mostly unchanged, had risen by 6 points, or 0.1%, and had advancedby 26 points, or 0.1%.

The main averages slumped on Wednesday, weighed down by a spike in U.S. Treasury yields partly sparked by concerns that Trump’s tax bill would add trillions of dollars to America’s already-massive debt pile. Weak demand for a $16 billion auction of 20-year Treasury bonds also put upward pressure on yields, which tend to move inversely to prices.

Traders were also assessing mixed earnings from retail companies, which have been seen as potentially exposed to punishing U.S. tariffs. Home improvement firm Lowe’s (NYSE: ) backed its full-year guidance, although numbers from big-box group Target — whose offerings include more on discretionary items — disappointed.

2. Flash PMIs ahead

Investors are now turning their focus to an upcoming preliminary reading of business activity that could provide fresh insight into the impact of Trump’s tariffs.

S&P Global’s composite purchasing managers’ index cooled to 50.6 last month, down from 53.5 in March and only slightly above the 50-point level denoting expansion.

The index’s tracker of the manufacturing sector is seen slowing to 49.9 in May, while the services gauge is expected to edge up slightly to 51.0.

Several companies have flagged that uncertainty around the effect of the sweeping U.S. levies have made planning out future investments more difficult. Analysts have noted that while the duties have yet to heavily sway U.S. inflation, prices could start to move higher as businesses use up inventories built prior to the implementation of the tariffs.

Murkiness also surrounds whether Trump will extend a delay to his elevated “reciprocal” levies on a host of countries after the pause expires in July. A separate postponement of tariffs on China are also due to end in August.

3. House moves ahead with tax and spending bill

The U.S. House of Representatives is tipped to hold a pre-dawn vote on Trump’s ""big, beautiful"" budget bill, with Republicans in power in the chamber hoping to overcome days of internal disagreements over the measure.

Along with the extension of 2017 tax cuts, the legislation would slash taxes charged on tips and car loans, while boosting spending on defense and border security. Reductions to key food and health programs for low-income Americans are also included in the bill.

Nonpartisan analysts have said the changes would add between $3 trillion to $5 trillion to the U.S.’s $36.2 trillion debt load.

Still, it remained uncertain if House Speaker Mike Johnson had secured enough Republcian support to pass the bill. Some GOP lawmakers have demanded even greater spending cuts to offset Trump’s desired tax breaks, although Johnson said he was confident he could garner their backing to overcome united Democratic opposition.

Should it pass the House, the bill would go to the Senate, which is also controlled by Republicans.

4. OpenAI aims to begin shipping AI devices by late-2026 -- WSJ

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told employees that he plans to lead the company in shipping a planned AI device by at least end-2026, the Wall Street Journal has reported.

Altman told employees at the AI startup that he was targeting sales of 100 million devices, and that OpenAI was seeking to create a new class of devices as integral as a smartphone, the WSJ report said, citing a recording of a meeting between Altman and OpenAI employees.

Altman’s comments come just after OpenAI bought a company led by former Apple (NASDAQ: ) designer Jony Ive for $6.5 billion earlier this week. Altman said that the deal had the potential to add $1 trillion in value to OpenAI, the WSJ reported.

Altman and Ive were reportedly aiming to create a third core device for everyday use, after a smartphone and a personal computer. The AI device will reportedly feature no screens, will not be a phone, and is not a wearable.

5. Oil retreats

Oil prices fell Thursday as traders digested a surprise build in stockpiles, as well as uncertainty ahead of renewed U.S.-Iran nuclear negotiations and talk of an Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear sites.

At 03:32 ET, futures dropped 1.6% to $63.89 a barrel, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 1.5% to $60.60 a barrel.

The Energy Information Administration reported late Wednesday a 1.3 million-barrel rise in U.S. crude oil inventories, defying expectations of a 1.3 million-barrel drawdown and raising concerns about demand from the world’s largest oil consumer.

Both benchmarks retreated on Wednesday after reports that nuclear talks between Iran and the United States will take place on Friday in Rome.

Dip-buying in tech stocks, led by Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), helped the broader market steady, with the latter adding to this weeks gains following its developer conference earlier this week.

The tech giant used the event to defend its Search product, which is under threat from newer generative AI rivals.

Elsewhere in tech, Snowflake (NYSE: ) stock surged after the cloud-based data storage company raised its fiscal 2026 forecast for product revenue, betting on strong demand for its data analytics services as enterprises prioritize artificial intelligence spending.

House passes tax and spending bill

U.S. President Donald Trump’s tax bill narrowly passed the House on Thursday morning, overcoming days of political wrangling between Republicans in control of the lower chamber of Congress.

The measure passed by a narrow 215-214 margin, with all Democrats opposing the bill.

The bill now moves to the Senate, where some lawmakers are pushing for revisions, with a vote on approval expected by August.

The U.S. House Rules Committee on late Wednesday approved President Donald Trump’s expansive tax and spending bill after a nearly 22-hour session, media reports showed.

Along with the extension of 2017 tax cuts, the legislation would slash taxes charged on tips and car loans, while boosting spending on defense and border security. Reductions to key food and health programs for low-income Americans are also included in the bill.

Critics have expressed concerns over potential cuts to social programs and increased national debt. Nonpartisan analysts have estimated that the reductions could add between $3 trillion to $5 trillion to the country’s $36.2 trillion debt pile over the next decade.

Jobless claims point to still-solid labor market

Economic concerns, exacerbated by the trade turmoil over the last couple of months, have also weighed on stock markets.

The number of Americans filing dropped last week, suggesting the economy maintained a steady pace of job growth in May.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 227,000 for the week ended May 17, the Labor Department said on Thursday.

S&P Global’s cooled to 50.6 last month, down from 53.5 in March and only slightly above the 50-point level denoting expansion.

The index’s tracker of the manufacturing sector is seen slowing to 49.9 in May, while the services gauge is expected to edge up slightly to 51.0.

Urban Outfitters shines on earnings stage

Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ: ) stock soaring following a stronger-than-expected quarterly report - the second straight quarter of strong revenue gains and the third consecutive quarter of accelerating EPS growth.

Analog Devices (NASDAQ: ) stock rose after the chipmaker beat expectations for quarterly revenue, driven by upbeat demand for its chips used in the automotive and industrial sectors.

Additionally, Nike (NYSE: ) stock rose 2% after the footwear retailer said it is planning to raise prices of some products from next week and will sell items on Amazon (NASDAQ: ) after six years.

The quarterly analysis, based on 13-F filings from 684 hedge funds managing $3.1 trillion in gross equity positions, shows a shift away from the “Magnificent 7” stocks, even as those names outperformed.

“Funds cut net positions most in Microsoft (NASDAQ: ),” Goldman noted, placing the tech giant on its list of “Falling Stars” — a group of stocks that saw the largest decline in hedge fund ownership.

Apple (NASDAQ: ) also lost ground, slipping from the sixth to the ninth spot on Goldman’s Hedge Fund VIP list, displaced by Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: ), Netflix (NASDAQ: ), and Uber (NYSE: ).

Despite the pullback, Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft, Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) still top the list of most-owned stocks.

The timing of these trades proved costly. “These rotations proved poorly timed as the Mag 7 has returned +12% during 2QTD while trade tensions have weighed on China ADRs,” Goldman strategists led by Ben Snider noted.

Hedge funds added to China ADRs during the first quarter, increasing exposure to names like Alibaba (NYSE: ), PDD Holdings (NASDAQ: ), Baidu (NASDAQ: ), and JD.com (NASDAQ: ), even as geopolitical uncertainty loomed.

While the basket of China ADRs outperformed in Q1, it has underperformed the equal-weight by five percentage points since the start of Q2.

Still, performance held up. “Solid stock-picking has allowed U.S. equity long/short hedge funds to maintain a return of +1% YTD despite a volatile macro backdrop,” the report said. The VIP basket of most popular long positions outperformed, up 6% year-to-date.

The overall hedge fund landscape remains heavily tilted toward high leverage. Gross leverage hit a record, fueled by surging short interest.

Hedge funds entered Q2 with $948 billion in single-stock shorts and $218 billion in ETF shorts. Short interest in the median S&P 500 stock climbed to 2.3% of float, the highest since the 2021 short squeeze.

NDX,2025-05-21,03:28,"Retail earnings ahead, Nvidia CEO on U.S. chip controls","Investing.com - U.S. stock futures dropped on Wednesday, after a modest uptick in Treasury yields weighed on stocks in the previous session. Markets are looking ahead to fresh retail earnings, with investors keen for any insight into the impact of President Donald Trump’s punishing tariffs on prices. Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) CEO Jensen Huang comments on U.S. curbs on artificial intelligence chip exports to China, while inflation in the U.K. surges.

1. Futures dip

U.S. stock futures edged lower on Wednesday, pointing to an extension to a drop in equities in the prior session.

By 03:18 ET (07:18 GMT), the contract had slipped by 172 points, or 0.4%, dropped by 29 points, or 0.5%, and fell by 125 points, or 0.6%.

The main averages on Wall Street retreated on Tuesday, as stocks were weighed down by 10-year U.S. Treasury yields, which touched an intraday high before easing back to settle at around 4.48%. In a note to clients, analysts at UBS said this was an indication that a Moody’s downgrade of its U.S. credit rating late last week did not come as a surprise ""as the worsening U.S. fiscal outlook is well known by investors"".

""Instead, markets are likely focused on the progress of ongoing trade negotiations as well as the ’one big, beautiful bill’ [...] Trump is trying to push through,"" the brokerage noted.

Trump went to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to persuade Republican lawmakers to pass his massive budget bill, which some analysts have estimated could add between $3 trillion to $5 trillion to the U.S. government’s $36.2 trillion debt load.

At the end of the trading day, the benchmark had declined by 0.39%, snapping six-session winning streak.

Home Depot (NYSE: ) shares pared back earlier gains to finish lower, while Tesla (NASDAQ: )’s stock inched up by 0.5% after CEO Elon Musk said he plans to be at the helm of the electric carmaker in five years.

2. Retail earnings ahead

Investors will have the chance to parse through earnings from more retail chains on Wednesday, with the impact of Trump’s aggressive tariff agenda in focus.

Department store group TJX Companies (NYSE: ) and home improvement firm Lowe’s Companies (NYSE: ) are both due to deliver their results before the start of U.S. trading.

The figures come against a backdrop of increased tariff tensions that have contributed to gloomy returns and forecasts from a host of consumer-facing companies. This includes big-box retail titan Walmart (NYSE: ), which warned last week of impending price hikes.

On Tuesday, Home Depot said it would keep prices steady, although it flagged that the duties may cause some products to disappear from the do-it-yourself retailer’s shelves.

3. Nvidia CEO on U.S. AI chip export controls

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on Wednesday that U.S. export restrictions on artificial intelligence chips to China had failed to prevent Beijing’s advancements in the industry, pushing businesses towards locally-developed processors.

“I think, all in all, the export control was a failure,” Huang told reporters at Taiwan’s Computex conference. “The export control gave [local companies] the spirit, the energy, and the government support to accelerate their development.”

Huang also noted that Nvidia’s market share in China has slumped to 50%, down from 95% at the start of former U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration. Biden oversaw a slew of restrictions on the export of crucial AI tech to China that Trump has largely maintained or even deepened.

The U.S. Department of Commerce recently issued new guidance aimed at further restricting China’s chip industry, with the agency stating that use of certain chips from Huawei violated U.S. export laws.

4. U.K. inflation surges

U.K. inflation jumped sharply in April, hitting its highest level in over a year, potentially causing the Bank of England to delay any further interest rate cuts.

Annual consumer price inflation rose 3.5% in March, above the 2.6% seen the prior month, and considerably above the U.K. central bank’s 2.0% medium-term target. The monthly rate rose 1.2%, a steep uptick from the 0.3% seen in March.

Analysts had expected the CPI to rise 3.3% on an annual basis, and 1.1% on the month.

Core CPI, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, rose 1.4% on a monthly basis, with the annual rate at 3.8%.

This acceleration in inflation came as the country faced a confluence of factors that are likely to drive up prices, including substantial hikes in energy and water bills, adjustments to vehicle excise duty, and rises to council taxes.

5. Oil rises

Oil prices surged higher following reports Israel is preparing a strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, raising fears supply could be hit from this key Middle East producing region.

At 03:22 ET, futures soared 1.1% to $66.08 a barrel, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 1.2% to $62.77 a barrel.

Israel is preparing for a potential military strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, as the U.S. continues to pursue a diplomatic agreement with Tehran, CNN reported on Tuesday, citing multiple U.S. officials familiar with recent intelligence.

The report said that the Israeli leaders have not made a final decision yet, but the likelihood of an Israeli strike has ""gone up significantly"" in recent months.

Additionally, stockpiles increased by approximately 2.5 million barrels for the week ending May 16, according to data from the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday, defying forecasts for a 1.9 million-barrel draw.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/retail-earnings-ahead-nvidia-ceo-on-us-chip-controls--whats-moving-markets-4056160
NDX,2025-05-20,07:03,Citi’s Montagu: Improved U.S.-China tariff outlook leads to positioning rebound By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- Positioning in global equity markets rebounded sharply following the recent U.S.-China trade truce, according to Citigroup (NYSE: ) strategists. The recovery was most visible in U.S. indices, where improved sentiment around tariff negotiations spurred new risk flows and short covering.

Positioning in the and returned to bullish territory, driven by a combination of long accumulation and unwinding of shorts. Strategists led by Chris Montagu highlighted that “U.S. equity positioning increased for large-cap indexes as new risk flows and short unwinds dominated weekly position activity.”

Nasdaq, in particular, saw positioning bounce significantly, though Citi noted that notional levels remain well below extended thresholds.

In contrast, small-cap positioning in the saw less movement despite six consecutive weeks of gains, reflecting waning momentum.

In Europe, equity positioning also improved. , , and European banks all recorded gains, while eased slightly but held net bullish.

Citi notes that European banks stood out with “prominently bullish and elevated” positioning.

“In addition to recent strong sector earnings performance, a sustainable longer-term earnings outlook alongside higher dividend yields is increasing the appeal for and being reflected in current positioning,” the strategists said.

“European Banks ETF flows mirror this on-going bullish trend, with ETF positioning and profit levels extended for European Banks,” they added.

Asia saw a broad-based improvement, with positioning climbing for the second week in a row, particularly in China.

According to Citi, China’s index positioning has sharply returned to elevated levels, with normalized scores for the index outpacing the recovery in market prices.

All tracked indexes in the region now show bullish positioning except the , where sentiment remains near neutral amid lingering U.S.-Japan trade uncertainty and weaker domestic growth signals.

Montagu also pointed out that legacy short positions across several indices are now offside, especially in EuroStoxx, adding that “the combined position and loss setup could lead to a near-term short-covering rally, potentially fueling further upside.”",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/citis-montagu-improved-uschina-tariff-outlook-leads-to-positioning-rebound-4054502
NDX,2025-05-20,03:31,what’s moving markets By Investing.com,"Investing.com - U.S. stock futures edge down, with markets eyeing the prospect of future U.S. trade agreements. No deals are set to come out of a Group of Seven finance ministers meeting in Canada this week, according to Reuters, but reports say the U.S. and Japan will hold talks in the coming days. President Donald Trump’s tariff agenda will likely play a central role in Home Depot (NYSE: )’s latest earnings, particularly after Walmart (NYSE: ) noted that it would probably soon raise prices because of the levies.

1. Futures lower

U.S. stock futures ticked lower on Tuesday after investors widely shrugged off a Moody’s U.S. credit downgrade in the prior session and hoped for more trade agreements from the Trump administration.

By 03:27 ET (07:27 GMT), the contract had slid by 75 points, or 0.2%, had dropped by 20 points, or 0.3%, and had fallen by 95 points, or 0.4%.

The main averages on Wall Street closed higher on Monday, rebounding from an initial dip following Moody’s credit rating slash late last week. U.S. Treasury yields eased back somewhat from an initial jump, but remain at elevated levels.

“Stock[s] are still riding on the momentum from last week’s ’Big 3’ sources of bullish news (tariff de-escalation with China, cool U.S. inflation data, and healthy April-end earnings) and nothing happened Monday to derail that trend,” analysts at Vital Knowledge said in a note to clients.

2. No trade deals expected at G7 meeting - report

The U.S. Treasury Department does not expect to reveal any trade deals at a meeting of Group of Seven finance ministers in Canada this week, Reuters has reported.

Citing a source briefed on the gathering, the Treasury Department will also not agree to a joint communique unless it serves their interest.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is due to speak with Japanese counterparts at the meeting in the Canadian province of Alberta, the news agency reported. Trade talks between Japan and the U.S. are set to take place later this week, in the third round of high-level discussions between the nations, Japan’s Kyodo News agency reported on Tuesday.

Since the announcement of an agreement between the U.S. and China last week, investors have been eagerly awaiting more trade developments. Trump previously delayed harsh tariffs on most countries, but the clock is ticking towards the end of that pause in July.

Bessent will also push allies at the G7 to take steps to combat the spillover effects of non-market economies like China, a Treasury spokesperson told Reuters. U.S. officials, including Bessent’s predecessor Janet Yellen, have argued that China has threatened jobs in market economies by flooding the world with cheap goods.

3. Home Depot reports

On the earnings calendar, investors are assessing results from Home Depot.

The group reported first quarter fiscal 2025 results that exceeded revenue expectations but fell short on earnings, while reaffirming its full-year outlook. The stock rose 2.2% in premarket trading following the announcement.

The world’s largest home improvement retailer posted revenue of $39.86 billion, surpassing analyst estimates of $39.25 billion and representing a 9.4% increase year-over-year. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $3.56, compared with the consensus estimate of $3.59.

Comparable sales decreased 0.3% overall but rose 0.2% in the U.S. Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted total company comparable sales by approximately 70 basis points.

Meanwhile, Bloomberg News reported that the retailer’s CFO said the company won’t raise prices due to tariffs. Any commentary from the company on its pricing strategy will potentially be under close scrutiny, especially after peer Walmart said last week that it would likely hike prices soon due to cost pressures from Trump’s aggressive levies.

4. China slashes lending rates

China cuts its benchmark lending rates for the first time since October and major state banks brought down their deposit rates, as Beijing pushes to ease monetary policy to help support the country’s ailing economy.

The People’s Bank of China announced that its one-year loan prime rate, a key metric used by banks, had fallen by 10 basis points to 3.0%. The five-year rate, which is a major factor in determining home mortgages, dipped by the same amount to 3.5%.

Although the step was widely anticipated, analysts viewed the relatively limited size of the drawdowns as an indication of potential wariness among policymakers currently attempting to negotiate uncertainties around U.S. tariffs.

Last week, Washington and Beijing agreed to bring down their tit-for-tat levies and delay the duties until August. However, universal 10% tariffs remain in effect, as well as 20% levies linked to China’s alleged role in the flow of the illegal drug fentanyl into the U.S.

5. Oil prices inch lower

Oil prices traded lower as traders digested signs of a faltering U.S.-Iran nuclear deal, while the prospects of negotiations toward a Russia-Ukraine ceasefire weighed on the sentiment.

At 03:28 ET, futures had dropped by 0.6% to $65.16 a barrel, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures had declined by 0.6% to $61.75 per barrel.

Iran on Monday reaffirmed that its uranium enrichment program is “absolutely non-negotiable,” a stance that continues to be a sticking point in nuclear negotiations with the United States. A successful agreement could lead to the easing of sanctions and an increase in Iranian oil exports, impacting global energy markets.

Investors are also monitoring the conflict in Ukraine closely, as a resolution could impact energy markets and geopolitical stability. Following a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday, Trump said Russia and Ukraine had agreed to immediate ceasefire talks. However, the Kremlin flagged that such talks would take time, while Trump indicated that he would not be willing to join some European countries in putting pressure on Moscow through fresh sanctions.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/futures-lower-home-depot-to-report-with-tariffs-in-focus--whats-moving-markets-4054097
NDX,2025-05-19,04:00,China urges U.S. to act ’responsibly’ after Moody’s downgrade By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- China has urged the United States to adopt responsible economic policies in the wake of Moody’s decision to strip the U.S. of its last triple-A credit rating.

Speaking at a press briefing Monday, a spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry called on Washington to take responsible policy measures to maintain the stability of the international financial and economic system and safeguard the interests of investors, Reuters reported.

The comments come after Moody’s downgraded the U.S. from ‘AAA’ to ‘Aa1’, citing mounting fiscal deficits and rising interest costs. The agency warned that continued political gridlock and a lack of fiscal discipline pose long-term risks to the country’s financial stability.

“The first thought to come to mind is: what took you so long?” analysts at Vital Knowledge wrote, noting that Fitch made a similar downgrade in 2023 and S&P acted as far back as 2011.

They pointed to the growing U.S. deficit—now unusually high for a full-employment, peacetime economy—as a key justification.

Moody’s had maintained a perfect rating on U.S. debt since 1917, making the downgrade historically significant. While the impact on Treasury markets may be limited in the short term, the symbolic loss of credibility raises fresh questions about U.S. fiscal governance.

U.S. stock futures fell early Monday as investors reacted to Moody’s decision to downgrade the nation’s credit rating. As of 04:00 ET (08:00 GMT), futures were down 398 points, or 0.9%. dropped 70 points, or 1.2%, while slid 306 points, or 1.4%.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/china-urges-us-to-act-responsibly-after-moodys-downgrade-4052044
NDX,2025-05-19,03:55,"Dow Jones, Nasdaq, S&P 500 weekly preview: Week of retail earnings, PMI data By Investing.com","Investing.com -- U.S. stocks extended their rally on Friday, with the notching its fifth straight gain and all three major indexes posting solid weekly advances, despite weaker consumer sentiment data and ongoing inflation concerns.

The S&P 500 rose 0.70% to close at 5,958.38, while the added 0.52% to finish at 19,211.10. The climbed 331.99 points, or 0.78%, to 42,654.74—pushing the index into positive territory for the year.

For the week, the S&P 500 gained 5.3%, the Dow advanced 3.4%, and the Nasdaq surged 7.2%, driven by a strong rebound in tech. Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) soared 16%, Meta (NASDAQ: ) rose 8%, and Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) gained 6% and 3%, respectively.

Markets were buoyed by easing trade tensions after the U.S. and China agreed to a 90-day pause on new tariffs, offering investors some relief from fears of further escalation. Investors are hoping for more clarity on trade policy in the weeks ahead.

This week, market attention turns to the economic fallout from recent U.S. tariffs, with a particular focus on how the uncertainty is affecting global activity.

Investors will be closely watching May’s U.S. purchasing managers’ surveys on Thursday for a timely read on manufacturing and services performance.

While most official U.S. data has so far pointed to a resilient economy, analysts caution that these figures are backward-looking and don’t yet reflect the full impact of U.S. President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff announcement on April 2. Despite some rollbacks, tariffs of 10% or more remain elevated by recent standards.

“Global activity is still showing resilience including in the U.S. where continued frontloading is supporting the ‘hard data,’” analysts at Citi noted. However, they warned that “‘soft data’, such as activity and confidence surveys, paint a potentially grimmer picture, particularly in the U.S. where consumer and business confidence are still deteriorating.”

Alongside the PMI data, the week will bring housing reports, including April’s existing home sales on Thursday and new home sales on Friday. Weekly jobless claims are also set for release Thursday.

Investors brace for retail earnings prints

Meanwhile, a wave of U.S. retail earnings this week will help gauge the economic impact of evolving tariff policies and challenge the recent surge in equity markets.

Reports from major names like Target Corporation (NYSE: ), Home Depot (NYSE: ), and Lowe’s (NYSE: ) will arrive at a time when fears that President Donald Trump’s tariffs could trigger a recession have started to ease among investors.

However, Walmart (NYSE: ) warned on Thursday that it will need to raise prices in response to high tariffs has shifted focus onto other retailers. Investors are now closely watching how companies across the sector are navigating a trade environment that remains highly uncertain.

These results are also expected to provide a fresh read on consumer spending trends, a key driver of the U.S. economy, which relies heavily on household consumption.

Other companies set to report this week include Snowflake (NYSE: ), Baidu (NASDAQ: ), and Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: ).

What analysts are saying about U.S. stocks

JPMorgan: “De-escalation in trade uncertainty, with U.S. dropping proposed tariffs on China from 145% down to 41%. While this is unlikely to be the end of trade noise, we think that the worst of it is likely behind us.”

RBC Capital Markets: “The gap up in the S&P 500 at the beginning of last week made sense in the context of the latest U.S.-China trade developments, which we see as reducing – but not eliminating – the headwinds to GDP growth and the tailwinds for inflation that have emerged since the start of the year. But this modeling also tells us that upside from here through year-end seems limited without another step-up improvement in expectations for the macro backdrop in the balance of the year and that the stock market may be a little ahead of itself from a fundamental perspective.”

Morgan Stanley: “The equity return/bond yield correlation is right around 0, having declined from the early April highs of 0.6. In other words, rate sensitivity is on the verge of increasing for stocks. On the monetary policy front, our economists don’t see the Fed cutting rates this year. Thus, the burden is on rebounding EPS revisions to push the rally beyond 6100 short-term as rate relief appears less likely at both the front- end and back-end of the curve.”

Capital Economics: “While we suspect the dust will continue to settle, there are some signs of residual stress in markets that aren’t directly related to Trump’s tariff and trade policies, and which may linger. Regardless, trade negotiations themselves may suffer setbacks before “pauses” on tariffs expire. Accordingly, we wouldn’t be surprised to see some renewed volatility, albeit less pronounced than it was last month.”",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/dow-jones-nasdaq-sp-500-weekly-preview-4052034

Moody’s notes worries over the multi-trillion dollar U.S. debt pile, as lawmakers in Washington discuss a budget bill that some experts say could add even more to the country’s obligations. Elsewhere, markets are monitoring comments from Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) CEO Jensen Huang at an event in Taiwan.

1. Futures slip

U.S. stock futures slid on Monday as investors assessed a decision by Moody’s to downgrade its rating of the country’s credit.

By 03:34 ET (07:34 GMT), the contract had dropped by 345 points, or 0.8%, had declined by 66 points, or 1.1%, and had fallen by 301 points, or 1.4%.

The main averages on Wall Street advanced for a fifth consecutive session on Friday, with sentiment bolstered by a U.S.-China trade agreement earlier in the week, which fueled hopes that President Donald Trump’s tariff agenda may not be as aggressive as initially feared.

Still, a closely-monitored gauge of U.S. consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan was weaker than anticipated in May, while one-year inflation expectations rose, as households fretted over the impact of the levies.

For the week, the blue-chip , benchmark , and tech-heavy all climbed for the week.

2. Bessent on Moody’s downgrade

The focus is now trained on Moody’s slash to the typically top-notch credit rating, with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent saying the ratings were a ""lagging indicator"".

Speaking in an interview with NBC News’ ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday, Bessent added that he believes ""that’s what everyone thinks"" of the grades from credit agencies like Moody’s.

Lowering its rating of U.S. credit by one tick to ""Aa1"" from ""Aaa"", Moody’s noted on Friday that debt and interest in the country are ""significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns"". The U.S. currently faces a $36.22 trillion debt pile, according to the Treasury Department.

In a statement, Moody’s added that ""successive U.S. administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs"". U.S. Treasury yields, which tend to move inversely to prices, moved higher late on Friday following the announcement.

3. Trump tax cut bill passes key panel

Against this backdrop, Republican lawmakers in the House of Representatives are racing to pass Trump’s so-called ""big, beautiful"" tax bill prior to May 26.

Despite ongoing internal disagreements over the legislation in the Republican party, this effort received a boost on Sunday, when the measure won approval from a key congressional committee.

Crucially, four hard-line GOP conservatives on the committee gave their assent to the bill moving forward, after having blocked its passage late last week. But one of those representatives told reporters that, while ""progress"" has been made, ""we didn’t get nearly far enough"".

Trump has called for an extension to his 2017 tax reductions and cuts to taxes on some forms of income, including tips, as well as a jump in spending on defense and border security. Some Republicans, however, are still asking for deeper decreases in programs such as Medicaid and the removal of tax credits for green initiatives previously introduced by Democrats.

The House may vote on the bill, which nonpartisan analysts have said could add $3 trillion to $5 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, later this week.



4. Nvidia CEO comments

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on Monday unveiled a host of new artificial intelligence technology -- both for enterprise and consumer applications -- when delivering the keynote address at the Computex AI exhibition in Taiwan.

Speaking for nearly two hours at the event in Taipei, Huang unveiled new AI data center technology, AI cloud and computing products for consumers, as well as AI software for robotic applications.

Huang touted NVLink Fusion, a platform that allows companies to more easily build out AI infrastructure. The platform opens up Nvidia’s servers to chips from other companies, which analysts said was a major development for AI technology.

Huang also announced small-form personal AI supercomputer products, new AI server technology, new AI agent software, and AI software to power robots. The host of new technologies will be developed in collaboration with several Nvidia partners, including Acer (TW: ), , Gigabyte, Marvell (NASDAQ: ), MediaTek, Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ), and Fujitsu.

Huang’s address showed Nvidia putting all its weight behind maintaining its lead in developing AI technology, with the company having ballooned in value over the past two years thanks to the fast-growing industry.

While some doubts over AI chip demand have emerged in recent months, markets broadly expect Nvidia to maintain its edge, even as the company grapples with new export restrictions on sales to China. Recent commitments from major U.S. AI spenders -- chiefly Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) -- to keep spending hundreds of billions on AI infrastructure, point to sustained near-term demand for Nvidia.

5. Oil slumps

Oil prices traded lower Monday, handing back some of the previous week’s gains as traders digested mixed Chinese economic data.

At 03:34 ET, futures dropped 0.5% to $65.10 a barrel, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 0.5% to $61.65 per barrel.

China’s industrial production rose more than anticipated in April, with factory activity holding up well despite pressure from heightened U.S. trade tariffs on exports.

However, domestic demand showed signs of weakness, as retail sales for the month came in below expectations.

Moody’s downgrades U.S. rating, cites debt concerns

Credit rating agency Moody’s downgraded the U.S. sovereign credit rating late last week to ’Aa1’ from ’Aaa’, and is the last of the major agencies to cut the prestigious treble-A rating after awarding it in 1919.

The move pushed Treasury yields higher, but Washington downplayed the downgrade, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent calling it a ""lagging indicator.""

Moody’s cited concerns over the country’s growing $36 trillion debt pile, which could be exacerbated by Trump’s plans to cut taxes.

A Congressional committee in the U.S. House of Representatives approved President Donald Trump’s sweeping tax bill on Sunday, setting it up for a House vote this week amid resistance from a group of Republicans.

This bill is estimated to add between $3 trillion and $5 trillion to the national debt over a decade.

Moody’s cut was widely criticized by Trump’s administration, which touted several measures to bring down government spending and debt levels. But the measures, especially the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency, have so far made limited progress.

Walmart should ‘eat the tariffs’ - Trump

Trump over the weekend said that Walmart (NYSE: ) should absorb price increases stemming from higher import tariffs, and warned the retail giant against any price increases.

His warning came after Walmart last week said it will not be able to absorb all of the tariff costs, and will need to increase prices on general merchandise coming in from China. Walmart said that even the lower tariffs agreed to by the U.S. and China last week stood to increase prices.

Walmart’s comments highlighted the growing headwinds faced by U.S. companies dependent on imports, as Trump sticks to his tariff agenda.

Walmart is the world’s biggest retailer and is largely seen as a bellwether for U.S. consumer strength. Its stock fell 1.5%.

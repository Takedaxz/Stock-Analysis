AMZN,2025-05-23,14:36,Amazon.com is sued over alleged sale of contaminated rice By Reuters,"By Jonathan Stempel

(Reuters) - Amazon.com was sued on Friday by consumers over its alleged sale of a wide variety of rice contaminated by arsenic and other ""heavy metals.""

The proposed class action in Seattle federal court covers 18 types of rice sold through Amazon, including from familiar brands such as Ben’s Original and Amazon-owned Whole Foods’ 365.

""Amazon sold these rice products with alarmingly high levels of heavy metals to an intended consumer audience that includes children, with no warning whatsoever about the dangers of heavy metals,"" the complaint said.

The lawsuit followed a study last week by Healthy Babies, Bright Futures, a nonprofit that focuses on babies’ exposure to toxic chemicals.

That study found arsenic in all 145 rice samples purchased nationwide, with 28% exceeding a U.S. Food and Drug Administration limit for infant rice cereal.

It also found cadmium in all but one sample, and lead and mercury in more than one-third of tested samples.

Amazon, based in Seattle, had no immediate comment.

Exposure to heavy metals has been associated with negative health effects such as nervous system problems, immune system suppression and kidney damage, and autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in young children.

The 18 rice products include two from Ben’s Original and three with the 365 label.

Plaintiffs Ashley Wright and Merriman Blum said they would not have bought or would have paid less for Iberia Basmati 100% Aged Original rice, one of the products, if they knew the rice was contaminated or Amazon never tested it for heavy metals.

Friday’s lawsuit seeks unspecified damages of at least $5 million for Amazon’s alleged violations of Washington state consumer protection laws.

Makers of baby food and dark chocolate have also faced many consumer lawsuits over the alleged presence of heavy metals.

The case is Wright et al v Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ), U.S. District Court, Western District of Washington, No. 25-00977.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/amazoncom-is-sued-over-alleged-sale-of-contaminated-rice-4062390

The data center, situated in Abilene, Texas, is part of the U.S. Stargate Project, led by top AI firms in the country, to boost America’s heft in the artificial intelligence industry amid heating global competition.

The cloud service provider will purchase around 400,000 of Nvidia’s most powerful GB200 chips and lease the computing power to OpenAI, the report said, citing several people familiar with the matter.

OpenAI and Oracle (NYSE: ) did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment, while an Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment.

The data center is expected to be fully operational by mid-next year, and Oracle has agreed to lease the site for 15 years, the report said.

JPMorgan has provided a bulk of the debt financing across two loans totaling $9.6 billion, while the site’s owners, Crusoe and U.S. investment firm Blue Owl Capital, have invested around $5 billion in cash, the FT report added.

The data center will help OpenAI reduce its dependence on its largest backer Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) as the ChatGPT maker’s demand for power has outstripped the supply Microsoft can provide.

For Oracle, the data center and Stargate present an opportunity for the firm to boost its cloud computing capabilities and catch up to market leaders Microsoft, Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Google (NASDAQ: ).

OpenAI, Oracle, and Nvidia are also involved in a Stargate project in the Middle East, where a new massive AI data center will be constructed in the United Arab Emirates, likely using over a hundred thousand Nvidia chips.

The first phase of the UAE data center will come online in 2026.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/oracle-to-buy-40-billion-of-nvidia-chips-for-openais-us-data-center-ft-reports-4062372

CANNES, France (Reuters) - Famed actors, directors and music acts like Adrien Brody, Duran Duran and Spike Lee escaped the Cannes Film Festival’s crowded Croisette boulevard on Thursday evening for the exclusive grounds of the nearby Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc for a good cause.

With tickets starting at $25,000, the amfAR charity dinner has been bringing stars to Cap d’Antibes, Cannes’ quieter, palm-lined neighbour, since 1993 in the name of HIV/AIDS research.

The charity said the benefit has so far raised nearly $300 million for its research programs on Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

Celebrities including ""Sing Sing"" actor Colman Domingo, award-winning actor Taraji P. Henson and Michelle Rodriguez of the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise expressed concern about what U.S. President Donald Trump’s budget and staffing cuts could mean for AIDS research and prevention around the world.

The United States’ ""recent reduction of a lot of those resources globally has affected the AIDS community profoundly,"" said Rodriguez on the red carpet ahead of the dinner.

""It becomes more important than ever, the work that amfAR does, not only in the research to generate drugs, just the advocacy that they have globally,"" added the actor.

The United Nations AIDS agency warned in March that there could be 2,000 new HIV infections a day across the world and a ten-fold increase in related deaths if funding frozen by the United States is not restored or replaced.

""It’s very disappointing when people are going to die for something they don’t have to die from,"" said Henson, the event’s host and actor from ""Hidden Figures"" and TV series ""Empire.""

Teri Hatcher, Ed Westwick, Heidi Klum and Lauren Sanchez, Amazon (NASDAQ: ) founder Jeff Bezos’ fiancee, also attended the dinner that featured a performance by pop rockers Duran Duran.",https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/celebrities-unite-at-exclusive-cannes-gala-to-support-aids-research-after-trump-cuts-4061050
AMZN,2025-05-22,18:06,Disney seeks to stop YouTube from hiring veteran to oversee sports and media By Reuters,"(Reuters) -Walt Disney (NYSE: ) seeks to stop Alphabet (NASDAQ: )’s YouTube, which announced on Thursday that it has appointed long-time executive Justin Connolly as its global head of media and sports.

Disney filed a lawsuit against YouTube in a state court in Los Angeles late Wednesday to stop the appointment, alleging breach of contract, unfair competition and interference with a contractual relationship.

Disney claimed that YouTube is and has been aware of Connolly’s employment agreement, which required him to work for Disney through at least March 1, 2027. He signed a new three-year contract in November 2024 that gave him a one-time right to terminate it until March 2027.

It seeks a preliminary and permanent injunction to prevent Connolly from further breaching the contract.

YouTube did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Connolly will manage the platform’s relationships with major media companies as well as take charge of the company’s growing live-sports portfolio, according to a source familiar with the matter.

The popular video sharing platform has been aggressively pursuing live sports for the past few years, alongside competitors such as Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ), in a bid to take advantage of its massive user base and large sports audience.

YouTube inked a $14 billion NFL streaming deal in 2022, which enables it to stream big football matches, while Amazon and other media firms also rushed to secure big sports streaming deals.

The platform has also expanded beyond traditional video sharing and into live TV, music and podcasts, and generates billions in advertising revenue from its vast content reserves.

Connolly spent over two decades at ESPN and Disney and exited his role as head of platform distribution earlier this week as Disney gears up to launch its ESPN sports streaming platform.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/youtube-hires-former-disney-veteran-to-oversee-sports-and-media-4061043

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Billionaire investor Bill Ackman told clients on Thursday that his hedge fund bought Amazon (NASDAQ: ) shares last month, betting earnings will continue to grow at the online retailer as President Donald Trump’s tariffs bite less than consumers initially feared.

Ackman and his investment team updated clients on additions to the portfolio at his hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management. ""The most substantial move is Amazon,"" chief investment officer, Ryan Israel, said on a conference call.

With a value of over $2 trillion, Amazon is one of the world’s most valuable companies and has long featured on Ackman’s list of most admired businesses.

As one of the world’s most voluble activist investors who often pushes companies to perform better, Ackman’s stock picks are closely watched for investment trends.

But Amazon stock had been too costly until early April when the market was battered by news of Trump’s heavy tariffs for imported goods and its price cratered.

""We felt that the company would be able to work through any slowdown in the cloud computing division Amazon Web Services and we did not judge that tariffs would have a material impact on the earnings in the retail business,"" Israel said.

Ackman and his team also expressed confidence in Amazon CEO Andrew Jassy, saying his ability to run the business more efficiently will allow for ""more profit margin expansion at a high rate of revenue growth.""

Pershing Square had also added stakes in car rental company Hertz and transport company Uber (NYSE: ) into the portfolio.

At the same time, the firm sold out of railroad Canadian Pacific (NYSE: ), Ackman said, noting that it is a position the firm sold ""with regret"". Ackman in 2022 built a new stake in Canadian Pacific, returning to one of his most profitable investments as rail firms eye a boost from the drive to cut carbon emissions and as manufacturing is brought back to the United States and Mexico from abroad.

But in order to buy the Amazon stake, Ackman needed to make adjustments and came to liquidate Canadian Pacific. He stressed that he thinks ""extremely highly of the Canadian Pacific team"" and has ""a very strong belief in the long-term future of the business.""

The team also trimmed investments in Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: ), Hilton Worldwide Holdings (NYSE: ), Universal Music Group (AS: ) and swapped the firm’s Nike (NYSE: ) stock into call options, calling it a ""deep-in-the-money strategy.""",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/ackmans-hedge-fund-pershing-square-bets-on-amazon-exits-canadian-pacific-4061007

AMZN,2025-05-22,14:46,Amazon stock rises following Pershing Square’s stake reveal By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- Amazon (NASDAQ: ) shares climbed 1.5% as Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square unveiled a new position in the e-commerce and cloud computing behemoth. The announcement came during Pershing’s first-quarter investor call, where Ryan Israel, Pershing Square’s Chief Investment Officer, highlighted the strategic value of Amazon’s dual business model.

Israel emphasized the strength of Amazon Web Services (AWS), which holds a dominant position in the cloud industry with over 40% market share. He projected a bright future for AWS, noting that currently, less than 20% of IT workloads are cloud-based, but this could rise to 80% in the future. The retail segment of Amazon, despite being less profitable than AWS, was also recognized for its ubiquity and customer-centric approach.

Pershing Square’s decision to invest in Amazon was driven by the stock’s price dip earlier in the year, which Israel attributed to concerns over a potential slowdown in AWS and uncertainties regarding tariffs. However, Pershing Square assessed these issues as temporary, and with Amazon’s shares trading at about 24.5 times earnings, the lowest multiple in the company’s history, they seized the opportunity to invest.

The investor call pointed out that despite the high valuation multiples historically associated with Amazon, the recent price offered an attractive entry point. Pershing Square’s confidence in Amazon’s ability to navigate through the AWS slowdown and tariff impacts, while maintaining a growth trajectory of over 20% in earnings per share, was a key factor in their investment decision.

Amazon’s stock movement today reflects investor sentiment buoyed by Pershing Square’s significant endorsement. The firm’s reputation for strategic investments adds credibility to their positive outlook on Amazon’s future performance, influencing market confidence in the stock.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/amazon-stock-rises-following-pershing-squares-stake-reveal-4060485

(Reuters) - Amazon (NASDAQ: ) is testing AI-powered short-form audio summaries on select product detail pages, the e-commerce giant said on Wednesday, as tech companies continue to integrate artificial intelligence across their platforms.

The new feature offers summaries about products based on an AI-driven analysis of product details, customer reviews, and other related information from the internet.

Currently available for a subset of U.S. customers, the company plans to expand to more products and customers in the coming months.

Users can access these audio summaries by tapping the ""Hear the highlights"" button in the Amazon shopping app.

Amazon has intensified its focus on AI integration across its business, recently revitalizing Alexa+, a voice assistant powered by generative artificial intelligence.

The company has also integrated tools such as Rufus, its generative AI-powered shopping assistant that answers various shopping queries, and Shopping Guides, which provide guidance and product recommendations, onto its website.

Tech companies have been rapidly deploying AI tech to consumers, spurred by the popularity of OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot.

AMZN,2025-05-22,12:48,Startup Anthropic says its new AI model can code for hours at a time By Reuters,"(Reuters) -Artificial intelligence lab Anthropic unveiled its latest top-of-the-line technology called Claude Opus 4 on Thursday, which it says can write computer code autonomously for much longer than its prior systems.

The startup, backed by Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), has distinguished its work in part by building AI that excels at coding. It also announced another AI model Claude Sonnet 4, Opus’s smaller and more cost-effective cousin.

Chief Product Officer Mike Krieger called the release a milestone in Anthropic’s work to make increasingly autonomous AI. He said in an interview with Reuters that customer Rakuten had Opus 4 coding for nearly seven hours, while an Anthropic researcher set up the AI model to play 24 hours of a Pokemon game. That’s up from about 45 minutes of game play for its prior model Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Anthropic told MIT Technology Review.

""For AI to really have the economic and productivity impact that I think it can have, the models do need to be able to work autonomously and work coherently for that (longer) amount of time,"" he said.

The news follows a flurry of other AI announcements this week, including from Google, with which Anthropic also competes.

Anthropic also said its new AI models can give near-instant answers or take longer to reason through questions, as well as do web search. And it said its Claude Code tool for software developers was now generally available after Anthropic had previewed it in February.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/startup-anthropic-says-its-new-ai-model-can-code-for-hours-at-a-time-4060373
AMZN,2025-05-22,11:56,"Google faces DOJ probe over Character.AI deal, Bloomberg Law reports By Reuters","(Reuters) -The U.S. Justice Department is probing whether Alphabet (NASDAQ: )’s Google violated antitrust law in its agreement with Character.AI that allows the tech giant to use the AI startup’s technology, Bloomberg Law reported on Thursday.

Antitrust enforcers have recently told Google they are examining whether the company structured the agreement with Character.AI to avoid formal government merger scrutiny, the report said, citing people with knowledge of the matter.

Google last year signed a licensing deal with Character.AI that granted the search engine giant a non-exclusive license to the chatbot maker’s large language model technology.

The company also hired Character.AI co-founders Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas, both former Google employees.

""We’re always happy to answer any questions from regulators,"" a Google spokesperson said. ""We’re excited that talent from Character.AI joined the company but we have no ownership stake and they remain a separate company.""

Character.AI did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment, while the DOJ declined to comment.

The DOJ can scrutinize whether the deal itself is anti-competitive even if it did not require a formal review, the report said, adding the antitrust probe was in the early stages and may not lead to an enforcement action.

Other tech giants have struck similar deals in the past year in their push for growth in the heated generative AI race.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) struck a $650 million deal with Inflection AI in March 2024, to use the AI startup’s models and hire its staff, while Amazon (NASDAQ: ) hired AI firm Adept’s co-founders and some of its team last June. Both deals had drawn regulatory scrutiny.

Google is already under pressure from regulators, with the DOJ seeking to break up the company’s dominance in the online search market and in digital advertising technology in two separate cases.

Earlier this month, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission backed the DOJ’s proposal to make Google share search data with competitors.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/google-faces-doj-probe-over-deal-for-ai-tech-bloomberg-law-reports-4060282
AMZN,2025-05-22,07:35,US climate pullback threatens planned debt-for-nature deals By Reuters,"By Marc Jones and Virginia Furness

LONDON (Reuters) -Billions of dollars of debt deals aimed at protecting vital ecosystems from Africa to Latin America are at risk of unravelling or may need reworking amid concerns that crucial U.S. backing is about to dry up under President Donald Trump.

The ’debt-for-nature’ swaps, which reduce a country’s debt in return for conservation commitments, have gained traction in recent years with deals involving the Galapagos (NASDAQ: ) Islands, coral reefs and the Amazon (NASDAQ: ) rainforest among the most prominent.

The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) has been a key player, providing political risk insurance for over half of the deals done over the last five years, accounting for nearly 90% of $6 billion of swapped debt.

A source with direct knowledge of the plans said the DFC had about five swaps in the pipeline which are now in question with CEO-in-waiting Ben Black and U.S. government efficiency chief Elon Musk both criticising its climate work.

The source did not specify how much debt was covered by the swaps but pointed out that the last few DFC-backed deals involved over $1 billion each.

Spokespeople for the White House and the DFC did not respond to requests for comment on future DFC involvement in such deals.

A DFC official who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed to Reuters it stepped down earlier this year as co-chair of a global task force set up in 2023 to expand the use of debt swaps.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has also hit out at multilateral lenders for climate change work amid a broader U.S. retreat that has seen it withdraw from the Paris Agreement to curb global warming.

Angola and Zambia and at least one Latin American country are among those whose ’debt-for-nature’ swap plans risk needing to be reworked or even abandoned due to DFC uncertainty, four sources that have been directly involved in the projects said.

Angolan Finance Minister Vera Daves de Sousa said her country, which is one of the most indebted in Africa and whose rivers feed the Okavango basin vital for endangered elephants and lions, has been talking to the DFC about two potential swaps.

One is a debt-for-nature deal, the other a broader ’debt-for-development’ swap tied to education and young people.

""We feel openness from them (DFC), but especially on the debt-for-development swap,"" de Sousa recently told Reuters.

""We respect their vision,"" she added. ""For us there is no difference – we have opportunities on the development side, and we have opportunities on the nature side.""

In Zambia, which late last year was looking closely at a swap linked to its vast national parks that are home to over 40% of Africa’s elephants, things have changed too.

""We are not completely shutting (the swap) down but we are not actively at it right now,"" its Finance Minister Situmbeko Musokotwane told Reuters, declining to specify the reason for the shift.

NEW REALITY

Generating money for conservation by exchanging costly government bonds for cheaper ones is seen as an obvious choice for smaller nations grappling with heavy debt loads and climate change pressures.

The UK-based, non-profit International Institute for Environment and Development estimates that the world’s 49 poorest countries seen most at risk of debt crises could swap a quarter of the over $430 billion they now owe.

Given the signals coming from Washington, those that do should drop hopes of DFC support and look at alternatives, said White Advisory managing director Sebastian Espinosa, who has advised Barbados, Belize and Seychelles on such swaps.

Those could include credit guarantees from major multilateral development banks, potentially alongside private sector insurers and guarantors, as pioneered by the Bahamas last year.

Historically, though, DFC backing has been crucial in scaling up deals, offering up to $1 billion in political risk insurance. That protects those who buy the new lower-cost bonds if the governments involved fail to make payments.

""Who’s going to step in? (to replace DFC) I don’t know,"" said Eva Mayerhofer at the European Investment Bank, which backed a 2024 Barbados swap. ""We won’t be able to do debt conversions that regularly.""

The Inter-American Development Bank, involved in five of the last nine debt-for-nature swaps, sometimes alongside the DFC —declined to comment on whether any of its plans were being affected.

Investment firm Nuveen’s Stephen Liberatore, who has been a cornerstone investor in some debt swaps, said while substitutes for the DFC could be found, the knock-on effects were yet to be seen.

""What is the price for a private entity (to provide risk insurance) versus a public entity like the DFC?"" Liberatore said. ""Does it change the amount of savings?"" which are then spent on conservation. ""That’s the ultimate question.""",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/analysisus-climate-pullback-threatens-planned-debtfornature-deals-4059430

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed a choppy session little changed on Thursday, erasing initial declines as Treasury yields eased off recent highs after the House of Representatives passed U.S. President Donald Trump’s tax and spending bill.

Investors are also weighing the impact of Trump’s tariffs on U.S. imports, including on consumer prices.

""The problem today was the tax bill, which appears to have passed,"" said George Young, partner and portfolio manager at Villere & Co in New Orleans. ""But we are thinking about bigger potential problems and the two main things on the table are tariffs and interest rates.""

""The market hates uncertainty and we’ve still got this overhang of the tariffs and the bond market, which is totally apolitical and totally international,"" Young added.

House passes tax and spending bill

U.S. President Donald Trump’s tax bill narrowly passed the House on Thursday morning, overcoming days of political wrangling between Republicans in control of the lower chamber of Congress.

The measure passed by a narrow 215-214 margin, with all Democrats opposing the bill.

The bill now moves to the Senate, where some lawmakers are pushing for revisions, with a vote on approval expected by August.

The U.S. House Rules Committee on late Wednesday approved President Donald Trump’s expansive tax and spending bill after a nearly 22-hour session, media reports showed.

Along with the extension of 2017 tax cuts, the legislation would slash taxes charged on tips and car loans, while boosting spending on defense and border security. Reductions to key food and health programs for low-income Americans are also included in the bill.

Critics have expressed concerns over potential cuts to social programs and increased national debt. Nonpartisan analysts have estimated that the reductions could add between $3 trillion to $5 trillion to the country’s $36.2 trillion debt pile over the next decade.

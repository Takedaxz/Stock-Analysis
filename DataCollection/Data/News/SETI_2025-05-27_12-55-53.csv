WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said on Wednesday it had upgraded Thailand’s air safety rating to ""Category 1"" a decade after a downgrade, paving the way for direct U.S.-Thailand flights to resume.

Thai airlines could not launch or expand services to the United States, either directly or as a code-share partner, under the International Aviation Safety Assessment ""Category 2"" rating the FAA had assigned in 2015 due to a shortage of technical officers and certification problems in transporting hazardous goods. The top rating shows compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization standards.

In 2017, Thailand resolved a significant safety concern identified through the ICAO Universal Safety Oversight Audit Program in 2015, the agency said on Thursday.

Prior to late-2015, Thai Airways flew direct between Bangkok and New York and Los Angeles.

In 2017, Thailand said it aimed to get an air safety rating upgrade by 2018. Bangkok is a regional airline hub and Thailand had more than 35 million foreign tourists last year.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-reinstates-thailands-top-aviation-safety-rating-4003675

(Reuters) - Foreign investors have soured on Southeast Asian markets as the rising threat of U.S. tariffs, worries over domestic growth and a surge in Chinese stocks prompt them to look elsewhere for gains.

Stock markets in Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines and Vietnam have seen a combined foreign outflow of $4.16 billion so far this year, their biggest combined first-quarter outflow since 2020.

While these countries were expected to benefit from U.S. tariffs on China as they did during President Donald Trump’s first term, the reciprocal tariffs he has proposed this time have brought the region into the crosshairs of the trade war.

That uncertainty along with worries about economic growth and currency weakness have led to an exodus of foreign money.

""For emerging market investors, there is little reason to be invested in ASEAN in the near term,"" said Gary Tan, portfolio manager, Allspring Global Investments, referring to the 10-country Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) that includes countries from Singapore to Cambodia.

Tan cites weak domestic consumption, declining trading volumes and their lack of exposure to the artificial intelligence sector as reasons for investors steering clear.

Chinese equity funds meanwhile have lured overseas investments of $3.3 billion this year, LSEG Lipper data showed, on the back of exuberance around startup DeepSeek’s AI models.

""Investors’ caution toward ASEAN may persist in the near term, especially as global portfolios lean toward economies with stronger growth visibility and policy flexibility,"" said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo.

Analysts expect the shift of capital towards China to persist because Chinese stock valuations are cheaper.

SETI,2025-02-26,04:33,"Thai central bank cuts policy rate amid slow growth, global trade risks By Reuters","By Orathai Sriring and Thanadech Staporncharnchai

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's central bank cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point on Wednesday, a move it said was a response to a weaker growth outlook and increased risks posed by global trade policy uncertainty.

The Bank of Thailand's monetary policy committee voted 6-1 to reduce the one-day repurchase rate by 25 basis points to 2.00% at its first meeting of 2025. That followed a rate hold in December and a surprise quarter-point cut in October.

Ten of 26 economists in a Reuters poll had predicted the key rate would be cut this week, with 16 expecting no policy change.

The move follows repeated government calls for further easing to support the economy and weaken the baht to boost exports, a key growth engine.

The central bank said the rate cut was based on the economic outlook and took into account slower gross domestic product growth and trade policy uncertainty among major economies.

""Regarding inputs from the political side and businesses, it's normal to exchange views and use this for evaluation. But I must say this time we based (the rate cut) on our assessment of the overall economic picture,"" assistant governor Sakkapop Panyanukul told a press conference, responding to reporter questions on political pressure.

Economic growth could be slightly above 2.5% this year, down from 2.9% seen in December, he said.

Sakkapop said the central bank was ready to adjust policy if the outlook changed, adding the cut was not part of an easing cycle and the bar would be high for further reductions.

""The Thai economy is projected to expand slower than anticipated, owing to structural impediments in manufacturing production as well as competition from imported goods, despite support from domestic demand and tourism,"" the central bank said in a statement.

The vote to cut was to align with ""financial conditions with the economic and inflation outlook as well as financial stability, and to better cope with increasing downside risks.""

Thailand's benchmark stock index rose rose as much as 2% after the decision, while the baht edged up 0.2%.

GROWTH CHALLENGE

Southeast Asia's second-largest economy expanded 2.5% last year, less than expected and lagging peers.

The central bank governor Sethaput Suthiwartnarueput last month told Reuters 2025 growth could be below 2.9% this year, while finance minister Pichai Chunhavajira expects growth of between 3% and 3.5%, driven by stimulus measures and strong foreign investment.

The central bank said the rate cut would not impact financial stability and headline inflation was expected to remain in its target range of 1% to 3%. Sakkapop said headline inflation was expected at 1.1% this year and 1.2% next year.

Annual headline inflation was 1.32% in January, after averaging 0.4% last year.

Pichai had on Monday said Thailand's low inflation meant there was room for an interest rate cut to boost economic growth and help weaken the baht to support exports.

Capital Economics senior economist Gary Leather said downside risks to Thailand's growth forecasts had increased but the central bank's easing cycle would be gradual.

""The weakness in the economy is putting downward pressure on inflation.... However, a period of entrenched deflation is a risk, and we think more monetary policy support will be required,"" he said in a client note, which forecast the key rate would end next year at 1.50%.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/thai-central-bank-cuts-policy-rate-amid-slow-growth-global-trade-risks-3891780

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's economy grew less than expected into the end of 2024, data showed on Monday, and analysts said hopes of an improving outlook for this year are clouded by concerns that the country's export engine could be hit with U.S. tariffs.

Southeast Asia's second-largest economy grew 3.2% in the October-December quarter from a year earlier, up from a 3.0% pace in the previous quarter, the National Economic and Social Development Council (NESDC) said.

That missed the median forecast of 3.9% growth in a Reuters poll but was still the strongest annual rate in nine quarters.

On a quarterly basis, the economy grew a seasonally adjusted 0.4% in the October-December quarter, below the poll forecast of 0.7% growth and the 1.2% expansion in the prior quarter.

""The momentum of the economy is likely to slow down,"" said Krungthai Bank economist Chamadanai Marknual.

""The government needs to quickly introduce measures to support industries, such as the automotive and real estate sectors, to stimulate the economy.""

The main stock index dropped as much as 2.8% to its lowest level in more than 4 years after the data, while the baht fell 0.3% against the U.S. dollar.

The economy has lagged regional peers as it struggles under high household debt and borrowing costs, and sluggish demand from China, which is also a key tourism market.

Full-year growth came in at 2.5%, the NESDC said, faster than 2.0% growth in 2023, while the growth forecast for this year was unchanged at a range of 2.3% to 3.3%.

NESDC head Danucha Pichayanan told a press conference that while government spending, private consumption and investment, tourism, and exports would support growth this year, Thailand's trade surplus with the United States was a risk as President Donald Trump imposes tariffs on trading partners.

""It is undeniable that Thailand is also in the spotlight on this matter... and that requires urgent attention to address and find ways to negotiate to reduce the impact on Thai exports,"" he said, as the agency upgraded its forecast for export growth this year to 3.5% from 2.6%.

Capital Economics said while economic growth has slowed, ""we are expecting a better year ahead, with loose fiscal policy and further recovery in tourism spending set to be the key drivers"".

The government is optimistic its signature ""digital wallet"" stimulus scheme and other measures will stimulate the economy as it aims for 3.5% growth this year.

The NESDC maintained its forecast for 38 million foreign tourists to visit this year, below the record of nearly 40 million in 2019, the year before the COVID-19 pandemic.

Despite the lower-than-expected fourth quarter growth numbers, Danucha said the economy was expanding and there was no need to cut interest rates at the moment.

""We should be calm and wait and see,"" he added.

In December, the Bank of Thailand left its main interest rate at 2.25% following a surprise quarter-point cut in October.

Last month, the central bank governor told Reuters the current policy rate remained suitable, given high household debt, even though growth could be below 2.9% this year.

The next policy review is scheduled for February 26.

2025-05-27,11:16,NeuroPace stock sinks following clinical study results By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- Shares of NeuroPace Inc (NASDAQ: ) plummeted 36.1% today after the company reported that its primary effectiveness endpoint for the NAUTILUS study did not reach statistical significance in the overall study population. The study was designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the RNS System for the treatment of individuals with drug-resistant idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE).

While the study met the 12-week post-implant primary safety endpoint, demonstrating a favorable safety profile of the RNS System, the lack of statistical significance in the primary effectiveness endpoint for the broader study population has raised concerns among investors. However, the company noted a statistically significant response in a subset of patients with lower baseline frequency of generalized tonic-clonic seizures, which represents the majority of participants.

Despite the setback in the overall effectiveness endpoint, NeuroPace highlighted several positive outcomes from the study. The data showed clinically meaningful improvements in median percent seizure reduction, responder rates, and an increase in seizure-free days over the first year of treatment. These improvements continued into the second year for patients who have progressed in the study, suggesting the RNS System’s potential for personalized patient treatment through programming over time.

Dr. Martha Morrell, NeuroPace’s Chief Medical Officer, expressed optimism about the results, emphasizing the statistically significant seizure reduction in a substantial patient subgroup and durable improvements across multiple secondary endpoints. CEO Joel Becker reiterated the company’s confidence in its long-term growth strategy and the potential for future indication expansion into IGE.

Leerink analyst Mike Kratky called the NAUTILUS study ""surprising and disappointing,"" but clarified that a follow-up conference call eased fears a bit. ""Overall, we would have preferred cleaner, more definitively positive topline results, but management has offered some reasons to remain positive on NPCE’s path forward in drug-resistant IGE,"" he said.

The NAUTILUS study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, single-blind, sham-stimulation controlled study that enrolled 100 participants, with 87 undergoing implantation of the RNS Neurostimulator and Leads across 23 epilepsy centers in the US. NeuroPace received FDA Breakthrough Device Designation status in 2021 for the potential use of its RNS System to treat IGE.

NeuroPace plans to submit the full dataset to the FDA and for peer-reviewed publication and will engage with the FDA to discuss regulatory pathways based on the data. These discussions may include utilizing overall median seizure reduction data across the full study population and pursuing a more targeted indication focused on patients with lower baseline seizure frequency, who may represent a majority of patients with IGE.

2025-05-27,11:12,TSMC still evaluating ASML’s ’High-NA’ as Intel eyes future use By Reuters,"By Nathan Vifflin

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) -Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW), the world’s largest contract chipmaker, is still assessing when it will use ASML (AS: )’s cutting-edge high numerical aperture (NA) machines for its future process nodes, an executive said on Tuesday.

Chipmakers are weighing when the speed and accuracy benefits of these nearly $400 million machines will outweigh the almost doubled price tag of what is already the most expensive piece of equipment in a chip fabrication plant.

Asked if TSMC plans to use the machine for its upcoming A14, and enhanced versions of the future node, Kevin Zhang said the company hasn’t yet found a compelling reason.

""A14, the enhancement I talk about, is very substantial without using High-NA. So our technology team continues to find a way to extend the life of current (Low-NA EUV machines) by harvesting the scaling benefit,"" he said at a press briefing.

""As long as they continue to find a way, obviously we don’t have to use it,"" Zhang said.

Rival Intel (NASDAQ: ) has planned to use the High-NA EUV machine in its future manufacturing process, known as 14A, in an attempt to revive its contract chip business and better compete with TSMC.

However, Intel also says that customers will still have the option of using older and more proven technologies.

During ASML’s last earnings report, CEO Christophe Fouquet said he expects customers to test High-NA for high-volume manufacturing readiness through 2026-2027, before they evaluate the tool on their most advanced nodes in a latter phase.

Last year, Zhang had told reporters TSMC will not use High-NA for its A16 node, adding he did not like the sticker price.

So far, ASML has shipped five of the 180 ton, double-decker sized machine across the world to three customers, counting Intel, TSMC and Samsung (KS: ).",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/tsmc-still-evaluating-asmls-highna-as-intel-eyes-future-use-4065599

2025-05-27,11:02,Goldman Sachs: Machinery supply is improving for the first time in three years By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- Goldman Sachs has upgraded Cummins Inc (NYSE: ). to Buy from Neutral, citing a turning point in machinery supply trends and improving fundamentals in the company’s Power Systems division.

“Machinery supply is inflecting positively for the first time in three years,” Goldman Sachs wrote, noting that its April Supply Tracker and backtesting reports support the view.

The firm has increased its weighting in the machinery sector and now prefers it over construction materials and environmental services.

According to Goldman Sachs, “new equipment destock is more than halfway complete, margin expectations have been reset embedding tariff headwinds, and valuations appear reasonable on mid-cycle earnings.”

The analysts believe that the supply picture has improved enough to justify a more bullish stance, with used equipment inventory changes serving as a leading indicator for production adjustments.

The firm now rates Cummins a Buy, highlighting “structurally higher Power Systems profitability (pricing structure beyond data center), derisked EPA 2027 expectations,” and “U.S. truck demand expectations that have been significantly reduced while used sleeper inventory levels are now down 30% year-over-year.”

Goldman Sachs estimates that Cummins is trading at 16x mid-cycle EPS of $20.50, or 14x if improved margins in Power Systems persist.

“We acknowledge our call could be early,” the note added, “as we expect production to bottom in 4Q25/1Q26, but we believe CMI’s Power Systems performance is a meaningful offset.”

The bank also upgraded Terex (NYSE: ), reiterated Buy ratings on Deere (NYSE: ), Caterpillar (NYSE: ), United Rentals (NYSE: ), and Herc Holdings (NYSE: ), and downgraded KBR (NYSE: ) and Atmus Filtration Technologies to Neutral.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/goldman-sachs-machinery-supply-is-improving-for-the-first-time-in-three-years-4065561

2025-05-27,10:46,Eos Energy stock tumbles after sudden CFO termination By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- Shares of Eos Energy Enterprises Inc (NASDAQ: ) fell sharply by 10.1% following the abrupt termination of the company’s CFO, Eric Javidi, announced on May 27, 2025. The company clarified that Javidi’s departure was not due to any issues with financial results or disagreements over financial practices. Instead, he was let go ""without cause"" and is set to receive severance as outlined in his offer letter.

The news has raised concerns among investors, leading to a significant drop in the company’s stock price during the trading session. Despite the company’s reassurances that the termination was unrelated to its financial or operating results, such executive changes often trigger uncertainty in the market.

In the interim, Nathan Kroeker, the current Chief Commercial Officer and former CFO, will take on the CFO responsibilities while continuing his role as Chief Commercial Officer. Eos Energy has confirmed that Kroeker will not receive additional compensation during his tenure as interim CFO.

This executive shake-up comes at a critical time for Eos Energy Enterprises as the company navigates the competitive energy storage market. The search for a new CFO is underway, and the company’s ability to quickly fill the role with a qualified candidate will be crucial for maintaining investor confidence.

The departure of a chief financial officer can be a significant event for a company, as the CFO is often seen as key to financial stability and strategic planning. Investors typically watch such developments closely for indications of internal stability and future financial direction.

However, Stifel analyst Stephen Gengaro reiterated a Buy rating and a $9 price target on the stock, saying, ""Our sense is he was simply not a good fit, and if there were any material issues, EOSE would have to disclose them in the 8-K. Given what we currently know and our trust in management, we are buyers on any material weakness today.""

As Eos Energy Enterprises continues its search for a new CFO, the market will be looking for signs of a smooth transition and sustained financial performance. The company has not provided any further details on the reasons behind Javidi’s termination or on the expected timeline for appointing a permanent CFO.

2025-05-27,10:29,Eli Lilly expands pain pipeline with acquisition of SiteOne Therapeutics By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: ) is expanding its neuroscience pipeline through the acquisition of SiteOne Therapeutics in a deal worth up to $1 billion, deepening its bet on non-opioid pain treatments. The centerpiece of the acquisition is STC-004, a Phase 2-ready Nav1.8 inhibitor that could offer significant relief to patients suffering from chronic pain without the risks associated with addictive medications.

The transaction follows growing investor momentum behind non-opioid alternatives as public and regulatory pressure continues to intensify around opioid misuse. Lilly said the acquisition aligns with its ambition to lead in next-generation pain therapeutics while bolstering its research focus in neurology.

""The global burden of chronic pain continues to increase, and an effective non-opioid treatment remains elusive,"" said Mark Mintun, Lilly’s Group Vice President of Neuroscience Research and Development. ""Lilly is eager to continue the development of STC-004 with the outstanding SiteOne team as part of our efforts to advance novel, addiction-free pain therapies.""

SiteOne, a privately held biotech, has spent years developing its proprietary platform around Nav1.8 channel inhibition, which plays a key role in pain signal transmission. The deal represents a strategic milestone for the company, which has yet to commercialize a product but has generated growing interest from pharmaceutical partners.

""At SiteOne, we’ve spent more than a decade advancing a vision to deliver safer, more effective, non-opioid therapies for patients suffering from pain and other sensory hyperexcitability disorders,"" said John Mulcahy, Ph.D., CEO and cofounder of SiteOne Therapeutics. ""Lilly shares our deep commitment to scientific rigor, innovation, and patient-centered drug development.""

Lilly will pay an upfront fee and additional milestone-based payments tied to regulatory and commercial achievements, bringing the total value of the transaction to a possible $1 billion. The company said the acquisition will be accounted for under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and reflected in its future financial guidance.

Investment banks and legal teams are positioned behind both sides of the transaction, with J.P. Morgan Securities acting as exclusive financial advisor to Lilly and Jones Day serving as legal counsel. SiteOne was advised by Centerview Partners, while Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and Cooley LLP served as legal counsel.

Pending closing conditions, the acquisition marks Lilly’s continued strategic push to diversify beyond its dominant diabetes and oncology portfolio. As competition intensifies in central nervous system therapies, the move could position Lilly on the front edge of a potentially transformative class of pain treatments.

2025-05-27,10:09,"Declining EV interest, pricing concerns may limit near-term growth for Rivian: UBS By Investing.com","Investing.com -- UBS analysts cautioned that Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: ) may face headwinds in the near term, citing findings from their 2025 UBS Evidence Lab Global EV survey.

According to UBS, “declining EV interest and affordability concerns may limit near-term growth” for the electric vehicle maker.

While Rivian’s brand awareness in the U.S. has improved slightly, from 10% in 2024 to 13% this year, consumer consideration is said to remain low.

“Only ~5% of BEV owners/buyers indicated they would consider purchasing a RIVN (up from 4.5% last year),” UBS said. For comparison, UBS estimates Rivian’s estimated 2024 U.S. BEV market share, excluding vans, was around 3%.

The survey also found that while many consumers still seek more EV alternatives, interest in EVs overall has declined.

“Given potential pushout of EPA requirements and repeal of the California waiver, the EV inflection may be further out than expected,” UBS warned, noting that removing the California waiver could also impact Rivian’s ability to generate and sell Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) credits.

Affordability also remains a key barrier, according to the bank.

“Only ~35% of respondents believed EVs are affordable vs. ICE vehicles,” UBS noted. Rivian’s current models—the R1S SUV and R1T pickup—start at $75,900 and $69,900, respectively, well above the $47,900 average price for a U.S. vehicle.

UBS also flagged risk around the possible elimination of consumer clean vehicle tax credits, which they estimate supported around 59% of Rivian’s 2024 vehicle leases.

“Near-term, especially if U.S. policies move away from an EV world, continued cost out of the R1 and increased manufacturing efficiencies are key,” UBS said.

2025-05-27,10:09,Vertical Aerospace stock rises following historic eVTOL flight By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- Shares of Vertical Aerospace Ltd (NYSE: ) climbed 6.1% after the company announced a significant milestone in electric aviation: the successful completion of the first-ever piloted wingborne flight of a winged electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft in European open airspace.

The test flight, which was approved by the UK Civil Aviation Authority, is a critical step in Vertical Aerospace’s journey towards certification and commercial operation. The VX4 prototype, piloted by Chief Test Pilot Simon Davies, demonstrated controlled wingborne flight, transitioning from vertical takeoff to cruising like a conventional aircraft. This achievement marks a pivotal moment for the company’s Flightpath 2030 strategy.

According to the company’s press release, the VX4 prototype performed exceptionally, validating performance predictions and confirming the aircraft’s stability, control, and energy efficiency. Over 30,000 in-flight parameters were recorded, with the aircraft behaving as anticipated. Vertical Aerospace is on track to complete a piloted transition flight in the second half of 2025, a key step towards demonstrating the VX4’s operational capabilities for passenger service.

Stuart Simpson, CEO of Vertical Aerospace, emphasized the importance of this event in their certification journey, noting that real-world piloted flights provide invaluable insights beyond what simulations can offer. The company’s approach to putting a pilot in the VX4 early in the testing process underscores its commitment to safety and the maturity of its program.

The UK government has also supported Vertical Aerospace’s development through investment initiatives aimed at advancing the country’s net zero and aerospace ambitions. The successful wingborne flight is not only a testament to the company’s progress but also to the UK’s position at the forefront of aerospace innovation.

Investors have responded positively to the news, reflected in the stock’s upward movement. As Vertical Aerospace continues to make strides towards commercial operations, the industry watches closely, anticipating the potential transformation of electric air travel into a practical, scalable, and economically viable mode of transportation.

2025-05-27,10:04,"Trump’s nuclear energy orders would boost uranium prices, investments, experts say By Reuters","By Mrinalika Roy

(Reuters) -President Donald Trump’s latest orders seeking to revitalize the U.S. nuclear energy industry could pull the uranium market out of its current lull and boost investor interest, industry experts said.

Spot uranium prices have fallen about 30% from peaks hit in 2023 as institutional investors pulled out, spooked by recession fears and geopolitical instability.

The prices briefly declined to $64.30 per pound this year after they touched a 14-year high of $82 in February last year amid a global clean energy push and expectations of tight supply.

But the latest executive orders, signed on Friday, could reinvigorate uranium production in the U.S. to help meet surging power demand, industry insiders said.

The demand surge is primarily driven by data centers that require massive energy to power the AI boom, and nuclear energy is an attractive option for Big tech firms such as Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Google (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Meta (NASDAQ: ) given its reliability and near-zero carbon footprint.

Nuclear projects, however, have been facing rising costs and competition from plants. Vogtle, the last U.S. reactor to come online, was $16 billion over budget and delayed by several years.

Curtis Moore, senior vice president at Energy Fuels (TSX: ), said the current weakness in uranium has made it difficult to advance new domestic projects, given a lack of investor interest - a sentiment echoed by other firms in the sector.

Stocks of Major uranium-linked companies Energy Fuels, Uranium Energy Corp (NYSE: ) and Encore Energy plunged 13%, 23% and 53%, respectively, this year.

Their shares rose between 17% and 23% on Friday after the orders were signed.

""(The orders) will provide further confidence that the Federal funds already earmarked to support the domestic nuclear fuel supply chain (will) get deployed quickly which in turn should attract more private investment,"" said Nick Amicucci of Evercore ISI.

Analysts see further upside, with incentive prices for new uranium production estimated above $100/lb.

""Even before the AI boom and SMR (Small Modular Reactors) hype, the uranium outlook was strong,"" said Robert Crayfourd from Geiger Counter.

Spot uranium prices are currently around $70/lb, with term contracts trending around $80/lb.

""(The decision) paves the way for renewed contracting and long-term supply confidence,"" said Marco Mencini, head of research, Plenisfer Investments.

Currently, U.S. utilities hold less than two years of inventory, with contracting down 40% in 2024.

The executive orders include a directive for fast-tracking licenses for new reactors, which would in turn boost contracting by utilities.

""This is essentially a wartime defense measure,"" said Justus Parmar of Fortuna Investments. ""We produce only 1 million pounds of uranium annually against a consumption of 50 million pounds. Nuclear energy is no longer optional - it’s essential.""

Industry insiders expect the policy to accelerate deployment of small modular reactors, encourage capital inflows and support reactor life extensions.

Travis McPherson of NexGen Energy (TSX: ) forecasts ""a mad rush to secure uranium sources.""

""It will be like musical chairs where many will be left standing without a chair.""",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/trumps-nuclear-energy-orders-would-boost-uranium-prices-investments-experts-say-4065411
2025-05-27,09:59,"Exclusive-Unilever to guarantee European ice cream workers’ employment terms for 3 years, memo shows By Reuters","By Richa Naidu

LONDON (Reuters) -Ben & Jerry’s maker Unilever (LON: ) has agreed to guarantee its ice cream workers’ employment terms in Europe and Britain for at least three years after the business’ spin-off, according to a memo, tripling the usual period in such deals.

Under European Union and British legislation, employees’ contracts and collective agreements can be renegotiated one year after sales or spin-off deals.

The decision will lock the new ice cream company into a three-year deal that will impact how it treats and pays employees in Europe, regardless of uncertainty or changes to the environment in which it operates.

Unilever announced the spin off of its ice cream unit, which includes five of the world’s top 10 category brands including Magnum and Wall’s, in March 2024 and said it would cut 7,500 jobs from the group globally to save costs. About 3,200 layoffs were initially expected in Europe but Reuters reported in November that the British consumer company had nearly halved this figure by moving people to the ice cream unit.

The new ice cream business will have its primary listing in Amsterdam.

""Working conditions will be protected for at least three years and cannot be worsened,"" according to the memo reviewed by Reuters and sent on Tuesday from the European Works Council to Unilever employees after nearly a year of negotiations with the company.

Unilever did not respond to a request for comment.

The ice cream unit’s roughly 6,000 workers will be able to maintain the same conditions on salaries, bonuses, share plans, pensions and holidays, according to a source familiar with the discussions with Mustafa Seçkin, the chairperson of the new company’s European business.

THE MAGNUM ICE CREAM COMPANY

The source, who did not have permission to speak with the press, said further layoffs were unlikely at the business, which generated sales of 8.3 billion euros ($9.4 billion) in 2024 and is to be named The Magnum Ice Cream Company.

On July 1, the business is expected to launch as an independent company under the Unilever umbrella, ahead of the demerger at the end of this year.

Ben & Jerry’s independent board members were not part of the negotiations with the European works council, nor were they consulted, the source said.

Unilever has been embroiled for nearly a year in an acrimonious legal battle with the independent board of Ben & Jerry’s, one of its biggest brands, over allegations that it is muzzling the Vermont-based company - including on political issues - hurting its ability to carry out its social mission.

2025-05-27,09:53,"Japan Tobacco may consider US manufacturing of Ploom devices, executive says By Reuters","By Emma Rumney

LONDON (Reuters) -Japan International is open to producing its Ploom heated tobacco device in the United States, an executive told Reuters on Tuesday, as the Trump administration’s tariff policies prompt some companies to rethink their supply chains.

JTI, a subsidiary of Japan Tobacco (OTC: ) which makes Benson & Hedges and Winston cigarettes, plans to launch its Ploom X heated tobacco device in the United States under a joint venture with Marlboro maker Altria (NYSE: ).

Heated tobacco devices heat up sticks of ground tobacco without burning them in an attempt to avoid the harmful chemicals produced via combustion. Currently, the companies only plan to manufacture the Ploom X tobacco sticks in the United States.

The devices themselves are mostly manufactured in Indonesia, with components coming from elsewhere, JTI’s executive vice president for reduced-risk products, Takehiko Tsutsui, told Reuters in an online interview.

""There might be a possibility to think about assembling in the U.S,"" he said, after announcing the Japanese launch of a new iteration of Ploom, dubbed Ploom Aura.

However, such a shift could only be considered once Ploom had meaningful sales in the United States and until then, it may make more sense to look at other locations, he said.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s threatened 32% tariff on Indonesian imports is currently on pause. Washington hopes its sweeping tariff regime will see manufacturing facilities and jobs return to the United States.

JTI and Altria need authorisation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in order to sell Ploom in the United States - a process that can take years.

Tsutsui said the companies are set to submit their FDA application for Ploom X around the middle of this year.

JTI also sells its Logic e-cigarette brand in the United States. The devices it sells are produced in China, Tsutsui said, currently subject to a 30% tariff.

U.S. sales of Logic are relatively small, so the impact of tariffs affecting the brand is ""very marginal"", he continued.

UniCredit put in its offer on Monday, the filing showed, without providing details in line with the EU competition enforcer’s policy.

“After a couple of quarters of inline results, we think NVDA has the potential to provide upside to muted investor expectations,” the firm wrote in a new note.

Lynx, which had previously highlighted concerns such as heating issues with the GB300 GPU and tariff exposure, now sees many risks as “priced in.”

The analysts credited Nvidia’s ability to “steamroll through” challenges ranging from delayed product launches and trade restrictions to grid limitations and scaling constraints.

They cited new growth vectors and capacity expansion as reasons for optimism.

“GB200 has overcome its teething issues,” Lynx said, pointing to a sharp ramp-up in production at Foxconn (SS: ) and a $500 million new manufacturing campus in Texas. Additionally, a resurgence in CoWoS capacity build at TSMC signals recovery in Nvidia’s supply chain.

Lynx also highlighted Nvidia’s “stealth entry” into Edge AI through its partnership with MediaTek, calling it a significant long-term opportunity, particularly in automotive and enterprise markets.

Tariff risks appear largely mitigated, according to the firm. “NVDA has in place a carefully crafted strategy to avoid nearly all tariffs,” Lynx said, noting recent exemptions from the U.S. Commerce Department and Nvidia’s diversified manufacturing footprint.

Lynx also pointed to “mega deals” such as the $500 billion Stargate project and new funding for AI clients like OpenAI and CoreWeave as likely to support future revenue growth.

2025-05-27,09:24,Moody’s shifts rating outlooks of Huaneng and Huadian to stable By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- Moody’s Ratings has adjusted the rating outlooks for China Huaneng Group Co., Ltd. (CHGC), Huaneng Power International (NYSE: ), Inc. (HPI), and China Huadian Corporation LTD. (CHD) from negative to stable today. The ratings agency also confirmed the A2 issuer ratings and ba1 baseline credit assessments (BCAs) for these companies and their guaranteed subsidiaries.

The stabilized outlooks also apply to several related entities. These include the A2 senior unsecured ratings of bonds guaranteed by CHGC and A3 subordinate rating of perpetual securities guaranteed by CHGC, both held by China Huaneng Group (Hong Kong) Treasury Management Holding Limited. Sinosing Services Pte. Ltd.’s A2 senior unsecured rating of bonds guaranteed by HPI was also affirmed. In addition, the medium-term note (MTN) program under China Huadian Overseas Development 2018 Ltd., guaranteed by CHD, maintained its (P)A2 senior unsecured rating, (P)A3 subordinate rating, and A2 senior unsecured rating of notes issued.

Moody’s Vice President and Senior Credit Officer, Ada Li, stated that the rating affirmation and outlook adjustment reflects the Chinese government’s consistent support for central-government-owned power utilities. She added that these ratings are resilient to a potential downgrade of China’s sovereign rating over the medium term.

Previously, the outlooks for these companies were switched to negative in December 2023 in response to the Government of China’s (A1 negative) sovereign rating outlook change. The change was based on the belief that financial support to stressed entities would become more selective, leading to prolonged risks for state-owned enterprises (SOEs). However, Moody’s believes that the Chinese government’s ongoing reform efforts will not reduce the very high likelihood of extraordinary support to CHGC, HPI, and CHD.

All three companies, controlled and supervised by the central government, are among the largest power generation companies in China. They have benefited from multiple central government statements reaffirming their critical role in ensuring national energy security, facilitating high-quality development, and executing national decarbonization policy mandates.

Despite the negative outlook on China’s A1 sovereign rating, driven by risks posed by the global trade environment, the companies’ BCAs remain appropriate at current levels.

The ratings of CHGC, HPI, and CHD incorporate their BCAs of ba1 and a five-notch uplift reflecting a very high likelihood of extraordinary support from the Government of China. The companies’ BCAs reflect their leading positions as large power generation companies in China, providing them with significant operating flexibility. However, their BCAs are constrained by high financial leverage, an evolving regulatory regime, and a challenging operating environment.

Moody’s expects CHGC, HPI, and CHD to maintain their BCAs within the projected range. The central government’s willingness to provide extraordinary support when needed is expected to remain stable over the next 12-18 months.

The ratings could be upgraded if the issuers’ BCAs improve or if the Chinese government’s ability and willingness to provide support strengthens over a sustained period. Conversely, the ratings could be downgraded if the government’s willingness to support weakens or if the companies’ BCAs weaken significantly.

The company is raising the funds by selling $1.5 billion in stock at its last closing price and $1.0 billion in convertible notes priced at a 35% premium, it said in a statement.

The bitcoin will be held on Trump Media’s balance sheet alongside existing cash and short-term investments totaling $759 million as of the end of the first quarter. Crypto platforms Anchorage Digital and Crypto.com will provide custody for the bitcoin holdings.

""We view bitcoin as an apex instrument of financial freedom,"" Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said, hailing the move as a ""big step forward"" in the company’s plan to acquire ""crown jewel assets consistent with America First principles"".

Shares of the company behind Truth Social, a streaming and social media platform, were down 6% in early trading.

Trump Media has been exploring potential mergers and acquisitions as it aims to diversify into financial services.

Last month, it reached a binding agreement to launch various retail investment products, including crypto and exchange-traded funds aligned with Trump’s America First policies.

(Reuters) -Circle Internet said on Tuesday it was targeting a valuation of up to $6.71 billion on a fully diluted basis in its U.S. initial public offering, as the stablecoin giant looks to tap into growing optimism around cryptocurrency.

New York-based Circle and some existing investors are looking to raise up to $624 million by offering 24 million shares priced between $24 and $26 apiece.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has embraced cryptocurrencies and pledged a more ""rational"" approach to digital asset regulations, encouraging companies from the industry to go public.

""The outlook for crypto IPOs is better than at any point in the past 3 years or so,"" said Matt Kennedy, senior strategist at Renaissance Capital, a provider of IPO-focused research and ETFs.

Progress in trade talks between the U.S. and its top trading partners has also injected life into the IPO market, prompting companies to go ahead with their stock market launches as tariff-driven turbulence has eased.

Circle is offering 9.6 million shares in the offering, while selling shareholders, including venture capital firms Accel and General Catalyst, are parting ways with 14.4 million shares.

Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management has indicated its intention to buy up to $150 million shares of Circle in the IPO.

The company’s flotation would be one of the biggest crypto listings since Coinbase Global (NASDAQ: )’s, stock market debut in 2021. Mike Novogratz’s crypto firm Galaxy Digital (TSX: ) also debuted on the Nasdaq earlier this month.

Circle had attempted to go public through a $9 billion blank-check deal with Bob Diamond-backed SPAC, but the deal fell apart in late 2022.

""Circle now returning to the public markets indicates regained confidence — but at a 25% lower valuation, which reflects more realistic market conditions and less frothy expectations,"" said US Tiger Securities analyst Bo Pei.

STABLECOIN FOCUS

Founded in 2013, Circle is the issuer of USDC, which has a market capitalization of over $60 billion and is the second-biggest stablecoin after , according to crypto market tracker CoinGecko.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are usually pegged to a fiat currency such as the U.S. dollar. Besides USDC, Circle also issues the euro-denominated stablecoin EURC.

Circle’s IPO comes as the stablecoin bill advances through the U.S. Senate, which could further accelerate the adoption of the digital tokens.

J.P. Morgan estimates the market size for stablecoins could grow to $500 billion to $750 billion over the coming years.

2025-05-27,08:07,US climate pullback threatens planned debt-for-nature deals By Reuters,"(Refiles to fix publishing issue with graphic)

By Marc Jones and Virginia Furness

LONDON (Reuters) -Billions of dollars of debt deals aimed at protecting vital ecosystems from Africa to Latin America are at risk of unravelling or may need reworking amid concerns that crucial U.S. backing is about to dry up under President Donald Trump.

The ’debt-for-nature’ swaps, which reduce a country’s debt in return for conservation commitments, have gained traction in recent years with deals involving the Galapagos (NASDAQ: ) Islands, coral reefs and the Amazon (NASDAQ: ) rainforest among the most prominent.

The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) has been a key player, providing political risk insurance for over half of the deals done over the last five years, accounting for nearly 90% of $6 billion of swapped debt.

A source with direct knowledge of the plans said the DFC had about five swaps in the pipeline which are now in question with CEO-in-waiting Ben Black and U.S. government efficiency chief Elon Musk both criticising its climate work.

The source did not specify how much debt was covered by the swaps but pointed out that the last few DFC-backed deals involved over $1 billion each.

Spokespeople for the White House and the DFC did not respond to requests for comment on future DFC involvement in such deals.

A DFC official who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed to Reuters it stepped down earlier this year as co-chair of a global task force set up in 2023 to expand the use of debt swaps.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has also hit out at multilateral lenders for climate change work amid a broader U.S. retreat that has seen it withdraw from the Paris Agreement to curb global warming.

Angola and Zambia and at least one Latin American country are among those whose ’debt-for-nature’ swap plans risk needing to be reworked or even abandoned due to DFC uncertainty, four sources that have been directly involved in the projects said.

Angolan Finance Minister Vera Daves de Sousa said her country, which is one of the most indebted in Africa and whose rivers feed the Okavango basin vital for endangered elephants and lions, has been talking to the DFC about two potential swaps.

One is a debt-for-nature deal, the other a broader ’debt-for-development’ swap tied to education and young people.

""We feel openness from them (DFC), but especially on the debt-for-development swap,"" de Sousa recently told Reuters.

""We respect their vision,"" she added. ""For us there is no difference – we have opportunities on the development side, and we have opportunities on the nature side.""

In Zambia, which late last year was looking closely at a swap linked to its vast national parks that are home to over 40% of Africa’s elephants, things have changed too.

""We are not completely shutting (the swap) down but we are not actively at it right now,"" its Finance Minister Situmbeko Musokotwane told Reuters, declining to specify the reason for the shift.

NEW REALITY

Generating money for conservation by exchanging costly government bonds for cheaper ones is seen as an obvious choice for smaller nations grappling with heavy debt loads and climate change pressures.

The UK-based, non-profit International Institute for Environment and Development estimates that the world’s 49 poorest countries seen most at risk of debt crises could swap a quarter of the over $430 billion they now owe.

Given the signals coming from Washington, those that do should drop hopes of DFC support and look at alternatives, said White Advisory managing director Sebastian Espinosa, who has advised Barbados, Belize and Seychelles on such swaps.

Those could include credit guarantees from major multilateral development banks, potentially alongside private sector insurers and guarantors, as pioneered by the Bahamas last year.

Historically, though, DFC backing has been crucial in scaling up deals, offering up to $1 billion in political risk insurance. That protects those who buy the new lower-cost bonds if the governments involved fail to make payments.

""Who’s going to step in? (to replace DFC) I don’t know,"" said Eva Mayerhofer at the European Investment Bank, which backed a 2024 Barbados swap. ""We won’t be able to do debt conversions that regularly.""

The Inter-American Development Bank, involved in five of the last nine debt-for-nature swaps, sometimes alongside the DFC —declined to comment on whether any of its plans were being affected.

Investment firm Nuveen’s Stephen Liberatore, who has been a cornerstone investor in some debt swaps, said while substitutes for the DFC could be found, the knock-on effects were yet to be seen.

""What is the price for a private entity (to provide risk insurance) versus a public entity like the DFC?"" Liberatore said. ""Does it change the amount of savings?"" which are then spent on conservation. ""That’s the ultimate question.""",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-climate-pullback-threatens-planned-debtfornature-deals-4064886

“The SPX fell 2.6% last week, trimming the MTD gain to 4.2% and pushing the YTD return back into negative territory, -1.3%,” JPMorgan said.

Despite this setback, the bank’s analysts argue the recent weakness represents a brief correction rather than a shift in direction.

“We had flagged pullback risk and believe that we experienced that last week,” JPMorgan said.

While the S&P 500 is still less than 6% below its all-time high, JPMorgan believes the “next 300 points” are more likely to be to the upside.

Their tactical bullish stance is based on three main drivers: “(i) stable macro data; (ii) positive earnings; and (iii) a further de-escalation of the trade war.”

Market volatility was elevated last week amid concerns about the U.S. fiscal outlook.

“While the 10Y yield only rose 3.4bps on the week, it traded in a 20bp range as the MOVE index increased 4.4%,“ JPMorgan wrote.

Meanwhile, international developed and emerging markets outperformed the U.S. last week, as the dollar continued to weaken, with the DXY falling another 2%.

JPMorgan highlighted that earnings from Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) could serve as a key catalyst, especially as the U.S.-EU trade dynamic experienced both escalation and de-escalation over the weekend.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/next-300-points-likely-up-for-the-sp-500-says-jpmorgan-4064865

2025-05-27,07:44,Should you buy a dip in BYD shares? JPMorgan weighs in By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- In a note Tuesday, JPMorgan analysts assessed the recent 9% drop in BYD (SZ: ) shares, pointing to concerns about a deepening price war in China’s auto market.

“BYD’s share price pulled back by near 9% today... which triggers investor concern of worsening pricing environment,” JPMorgan wrote, referencing unanticipated price cuts across BYD’s key “Ocean” and “Dynasty” model series.

The company announced discounts of 15–30% versus MSRP for 21 models, though JPMorgan notes the effective new incentives are closer to 5–15%, given prior discounts.

The bank explains that the cuts appear aimed at defending market share amid foreign competition and helping BYD hit its second-quarter delivery target of 1.2 million units.

While aggressive pricing may raise concerns about profitability, JPMorgan remains optimistic.

“As long as BYD doesn’t exceed its annual [sales and marketing] budget, the company should be able to deliver its full year profitability guidance of a sustained per unit profit of Rmb10k,” the firm said.

Their current model already assumes a record 4.3% of revenue allocated to marketing, up from 3.6% in Q1.

Looking ahead, JPMorgan believes BYD’s strategy to mitigate domestic price pressure, via premium model launches and overseas expansion, should preserve earnings.

“Specially, exports or overseas market is expected to account for ~15% of BYD’s total sales volume this year while premium brands (i.e. Yangwang, Denza and Fanchengbao) 8-10%. These two businesses would account for ~23-25% of total sales volume but 40-50% of earnings in our estimate,” they wrote.

With strong in-store traffic and resilient demand observed on a May 24 store visit, JPMorgan sees no immediate need to revise earnings forecasts.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/should-you-buy-a-dip-in-byd-shares-jpmorgan-weighs-in-4064822

2025-05-27,07:30,New surveys show declining interest in EVs and the Tesla brand around the world By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- Consumer interest in electric vehicles (EVs) and the Tesla (NASDAQ: ) brand is waning across key global markets, according to new survey data.

The latest UBS Evidence Lab Global EV Survey, which included over 10,000 respondents, shows a broad decline in Tesla’s standing as a preferred EV brand in the U.S., China, and Europe.

Globally, the share of consumers who would consider buying a Tesla has fallen to 36%, down from 39% last year. As a top battery electric vehicle (BEV) choice, Tesla slipped to 18% from 22%.

“The top choice decline was fairly prominent across the 3 major regions for Tesla,” UBS analysts led by Joseph Spak.

In the U.S., Tesla’s top choice share dropped sharply to 29% from 38%, despite maintaining a 48% share of the domestic BEV market. UBS attributes the slide to brand “saturation, a limited vehicle lineup, and affordability concerns.”

In China, Tesla fell to third place behind BYD (SZ: ) and Xiaomi Corp (HK: ), with top-choice preference down to 14% from 18%. Chinese consumers increasingly favor domestic brands, and Tesla is no longer viewed as the technology leader.

Moreover, Tesla’s top-choice ranking in Europe declined to 15% from 20%, with Audi and BMW (ETR: ) surpassing it in brand consideration.

Meanwhile, brokerage firm Stifel’s own survey shows that Tesla’s appeal is becoming more politically polarized in the U.S.

Net purchase consideration among Democrats dropped to -46% in May, from -30% in August 2024. Meanwhile, it improved among Republicans to -14% from -26%.

“The inflection point since August 2024 is likely due to numerous factors, but mainly Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s endorsement of President Trump and involvement in his Administration,” Stifel said.

“However, recent discussions of Elon Musk’s gradual scale back away from DOGE and political affiliations could lead to another inflection point in the data over the next few months,” it added.

Despite weaker sales volumes tied to shifting sentiment, Stifel’s team believes that progress on Full Self-Driving (FSD) and recent comments from Elon Musk about its rollout could be a more significant driver of Tesla shares in the coming quarters.

UBS’ data also raises questions about Tesla’s autonomous driving strategy. The bank found that only 12% of consumers globally are willing to pay more than $7,600 upfront for autonomous features, while just 18% would pay more than $100 per month. Tesla’s FSD product currently costs $8,000 upfront or $99 monthly.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/new-surveys-show-declining-interest-in-evs-and-the-tesla-brand-around-the-world-4064783

2025-05-27,07:23,"UniCredit can let BPM bid lapse, but will hold onto Commerzbank, CEO says By Reuters","By Valentina Za

MILAN (Reuters) -Italy’s UniCredit is ready to let its offer for Banco BPM lapse, CEO Andrea Orcel said on Tuesday, but added the situation was different for Commerzbank (ETR: ) where his bank owns a 28% stake and is prepared to wait.

UniCredit built the stake in late 2024 and wants to merge its HVB business in Germany with the country’s second-biggest bank, a plan that faces strong opposition in Berlin.

UniCredit’s offer for Italian rival Banco BPM is also in trouble after the government imposed conditions in order to clear it, which UniCredit has said could be harmful. It has filed a complaint with an Italian administrative court.

The court decision, however, won’t arrive in time, Orcel told the national assembly of Italy’s FABI banking union, and UniCredit could just let the offer lapse because it is not financially advantageous on its current terms.

The Banco BPM offer runs until July 23.

Matters are different with Commerzbank.

""We have 30%. I’ll repeat that: we have 30%. The fact that we’re polite and fair people who are waiting for the right moment to engage with the German government doesn’t change the fact that we have 30%,"" Orcel said.

He reiterated that UniCredit had three options: keeping the stake, selling it at a profit, or starting talks for a full merger, which Orcel has said he will only pursue if all stakeholders support it.

""We’re in no rush, we’ll wait,"" he said.

Orcel, one of Europe’s most experienced M&A bankers, has previously said a decision on what to do with the Commerzbank stake is a matter for 2026 or 2027.

Asked if Commerzbank might pursue a merger with a domestic rival as a defence strategy against UniCredit, Orcel said this was a risk, but that Commerzbank shares were not attractive because of the built-in M&A premium.

""Commerzbank trades at a 30-40% premium on all the other European banks because of speculation,"" he said.

He added that any buyer would need to own two thirds or, more likely, three quarters of Commerzbank.

""So whoever that is, they’ll have to come talk to us,"" Orcel said.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/unicredit-can-let-bpm-bid-lapse-but-will-hold-onto-commerzbank-ceo-says-4064761

2025-05-27,07:21,Rocket Pharmaceuticals stock tumbles after patient death halts trial By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- Shares of Rocket Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: ) plummeted 57% in premarket trading following the announcement of a patient death due to serious adverse events related to their clinical trial. The event has prompted a comprehensive investigation and discussions with the FDA, as the company seeks to understand the root cause of the complications.

The patient’s death occurred after complications linked to capillary leak syndrome, which emerged after the introduction of a new immune suppression agent in the pre-treatment regimen of the AAV9-Danon program. This agent was intended to mitigate complement activation seen in some participants. Due to this serious incident, Rocket has voluntarily paused further dosing in the study, with the FDA placing a clinical hold on the trial as of May 23 to allow for a detailed evaluation.

Rocket Pharmaceuticals reported having $318.2 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of March 31. In light of the current situation, the company is refocusing its investments towards its AAV platform and is considering strategic options for the rest of its pipeline to optimize value.

This strategic shift is anticipated to result in a reduced cash expenditure, with the company now expecting its existing resources to fund operations into 2027. This forecast does not include any potential income from the sale of Priority Review Vouchers, which may be granted following the approval of therapies from its hematology portfolio.

2025-05-27,07:18,"Jefferies upgrades Assa Abloy to “buy,” citing recovery signs and valuation By Investing.com","Investing.com -- Jefferies has upgraded Assa Abloy (ST: ) to “buy” from “hold,” pointing to early signs of cyclical recovery, solid earnings resilience, and an undervalued share price.

In a note dated Tuesday, analysts also raised the price target to SEK375 from SEK330, offering 24% upside from the previous close of SEK302.50.

The analysts estimated that around 30% of Assa Abloy’s business remains in a cyclical trough, down roughly 10% from peak levels.

However, improvement is underway. The Nordics, accounting for 5% of group sales, are rebounding after six rate cuts. U.S. residential, which contributes 15%, is stabilizing, with the LIRA index forecasting a 2.5% rise in renovation and repair spending by Q1 2026 despite elevated mortgage rates.

Loading docks, around 5% of group revenue, showed a rebound in orders in Q3 2024, setting up a revenue recovery in the second quarter of 2025.

Meanwhile, the U.K., contributing 3%, also remains at a cyclical low with recovery potential similar to the Nordics.

In the U.S., Jefferies expects nonresidential revenues to grow at a low- to mid-single-digit pace over the next 12 to 18 months.

The brokerage sees Assa’s specification writing activity, rather than the traditionally followed Architect Billings Index, as a more reliable leading indicator.

This outlook is supported by a 33% year-on-year increase in municipal bond issuance, which tends to precede public construction projects in education and healthcare.

Assa Abloy is also repositioning its supply chain in response to U.S.-China trade tensions.

About 10% of its U.S. cost of goods sold is sourced from China, but the company is shifting production to Southeast Asia.

This move gives it more flexibility than peers like Allegion (NYSE: ), which have fewer relocation options, and helps preserve margin while matching industry pricing.

Jefferies highlighted Assa’s margin resilience, supported by its aftermarket-heavy model, roughly two-thirds of revenue, and asset-light final assembly operations.

Its Q2 EBIT margin is projected at 16%, 40 basis points ahead of consensus. For 2025 and 2026, Jefferies estimates EBIT margins of 16.2% and 16.8%, respectively, both above consensus.

The analysts also pointed to continued momentum in mergers and acquisitions. After contributing 8% to revenue in each of the past two years, M&A is expected to add over 5% in 2025.

The company has already completed nine acquisitions this year. Jefferies also flagged a potential divestiture of the non-core Pfister plumbing unit, which could be valued between $250 million and $400 million.

With shares trading at 15x 2025 EBITA, below the historical range of 14.5x to 20x and at a 15% discount to high-quality peers, Jefferies sees room for re-rating.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/jefferies-upgrades-assa-abloy-to-buy-citing-recovery-signs-and-valuation-4064712
2025-05-27,07:06,Bank of Spain cautions on slowing income growth for lenders in 2025 By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- The Bank of Spain issued a warning on Tuesday, cautioning that income growth for lenders could slow down this year due to lower interest rates and geopolitical risks. The central bank stated it would need to closely monitor the credit quality of bank loans as a result of these factors.

In its semiannual financial stability report, the central bank reported that the credit quality is currently at favorable levels. However, it also warned of a potential deterioration if an economic slowdown puts pressure on borrowers.

Data from late 2024 and early 2025 shows that the ratio of bad loans in Spain has remained stable, slightly above 3%. This is significantly lower than the all-time high of 13.6% recorded in December 2013.

The central bank also reported a 3.9% drop in banks’ net interest income in the first quarter. This follows a rise of 22% in 2023 and 8.8% in 2024.

In addition, the Bank of Spain emphasized the importance of implementing the Basel III international capital rules. Delayed for some time, these rules remain a priority to prevent the accumulation of global systemic risks. The central bank stressed that these rules should align with the planned revision of the European Union’s supervisory framework. The aim is to simplify the framework without compromising the resilience of the banks.

2025-05-27,07:04,Strategy stock rises on new Bitcoin acquisition By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- Shares of Strategy, the treasury company led by Michael Saylor, climbed 3.6% in premarket trading following the announcement of a significant Bitcoin purchase.

The company disclosed on Monday that it had added 4,020 Bitcoin to its holdings, with an aggregate purchase price of $427.1 million. The acquisition was funded through sales of at-the-market, perpetual strife preferred stock, and perpetual strike preferred stock.

The move comes as Strategy continues to bolster its position in Bitcoin, with the company now holding approximately 580,250 Bitcoin, which were acquired for about $40.6 billion. These holdings are currently valued at over $63.5 billion, highlighting a substantial appreciation in value. The company’s aggressive investment strategy in Bitcoin has been a key driver for its stock performance.

Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer provided insights into the company’s Bitcoin strategy, noting the impressive yield generated from its holdings. ""Strategy’s BTC Yield, which represents the change in the ratio of its Bitcoin holdings to its total assumed shares outstanding from period to period, was 16.8% for the period between January 1 and May 25,"" Palmer stated

. This yield reflects the company’s ability to grow its Bitcoin holdings relative to its share count, which can be an attractive metric for investors assessing the company’s performance in the cryptocurrency space.

The analyst’s positive outlook is further reflected in a buy rating with a price target (PT) of $650 for Strategy’s stock.

2025-05-27,06:53,Salesforce to pay $25 per share for Informatica,"Investing.com -- Salesforce is nearing an agreement to acquire Informatica in a deal valued at approximately $8 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal.

The deal, expected to be announced later on Tuesday, will reportedly see Salesforce (NYSE: ) pay $25 per share for the data-management software company, people familiar with the matter told the WSJ.

The acquisition comes after earlier talks between the two companies fizzled out in 2024 over disagreements on terms.

Informatica, based in Redwood (NYSE: ) City, California, had previously been in discussions with Salesforce about a potential sale that could have valued the company at around $10 billion. However, those negotiations fell apart last year, said the WSJ.

2025-05-27,06:51,US government could hold U.S. Steel shares in Nippon Steel acquisition deal By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- The U.S. government may acquire a stake in U.S. Steel as part of a proposed deal that would allow Japan’s Nippon Steel to take over the American steelmaker, according to a report by Kyodo on Tuesday.

The report suggests that the U.S. government could hold a ""golden share"" in U.S. Steel. This special type of share would provide Washington with the authority to veto significant management decisions. This idea has been proposed as a potential component of the acquisition deal between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel.

This development comes as Nippon Steel, one of Japan’s leading steel manufacturers, is seeking to acquire U.S. Steel. The potential acquisition would further expand Nippon Steel’s global footprint. The possible involvement of the U.S. government in the deal indicates the strategic importance of U.S. Steel and the steel industry in the country’s economy.

2025-05-27,06:51,"US will have golden share in Nippon Steel’s takeover of US Steel, US senator says By Reuters","By Kaori Kaneko, Kantaro Komiya and Alexandra Alper

TOKYO (Reuters) -The U.S. government will have veto power over key decisions relating to U.S. Steel as part of a deal with Nippon Steel that would approve the Japanese firm’s bid for the well-known steel company, a key U.S. lawmaker said on Tuesday.

The details are laid out in what is called a national security agreement that the companies will sign with the U.S. government, said Republican Senator David McCormick (NYSE: ) of Pennsylvania, where U.S. Steel is headquartered.

“It’ll be a U.S. CEO, a U.S. majority board and then there will be a golden share, which will essentially require U.S. government approval of a number of the board members, and that will allow the United States to ensure production levels aren’t cut and things like that,” he told CNBC in an interview.

Nippon Steel declined to comment. U.S. Steel and the White House could not be immediately reached for comment. reported earlier in the day that a golden share was under consideration.

National security agreements get worked out in reviews led by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., which scrutinizes foreign investments for national security risks and has reviewed Nippon Steel’s proposed merger twice.

Japan’s top steelmaker has since December 2023 sought to seal a $14.9-billion bid to acquire U.S. Steel. But both President Donald Trump and former President Joe Biden expressed opposition to the tie-up, arguing U.S. Steel should remain American-owned as they sought to woo voters in Pennsylvania ahead of the November presidential election.

Biden formally blocked it in January on national security grounds, prompting a lawsuit by the companies that alleged the review process had been unfair. The Biden White House disputed that view. Trump launched a fresh CFIUS review of the deal in April and on Friday appeared to finally give it his blessing in a social media post, noting that the ""planned partnership"" would create ""at least 70,000 jobs, and add $14 Billion Dollars to the U.S. Economy.""

But on Sunday, Trump cast doubt over that interpretation, noting in remarks to reporters that ""It’s an investment and it’s a partial ownership, but it will be controlled by the USA.""",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-government-may-hold-some-us-steel-shares-in-nippon-steel-deal-kyodo-says-4064629
2025-05-27,06:47,Temu owner PDD Holdings shares fall sharply on big Q1 results miss By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- Temu owner PDD Holdings Inc DRC (NASDAQ: ) saw its shares tumble more than 18% after reporting notably worse-than-expected earnings and revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2025.

The Chinese online retailer posted Q1 earnings per share (EPS) of RMB11.41, falling well short of analyst expectations of RMB19.44.

Revenue for the period rose 10% year-over-year, RMB95.67 billion, but still missed the consensus forecast of RMB102.98 billion.

“In the first quarter, we made substantial investments in our platform ecosystem to support merchants and consumers amid rapid changes in the external environment,” said Mr. Lei Chen, Chairman and Co-CEO of PDD Holdings.

“These investments weighed on short-term profitability but gave merchants the room to adapt and focus on high-quality, sustainable growth, strengthening the long-term health of the platform,"" he added.

PDD’s revenue from online marketing services (OMS) and others came in at RMB48.72 billion, slightly ahead of the RMB47.99 billion estimate.

Meanwhile, transaction services revenue disappointed at RMB46.95 billion, short of the projected RMB54.23 billion.

2025-05-27,06:38,Temu-owner PDD Holdings profit dives as it faces challenges at home and abroad By Reuters,"By Arsheeya Bajwa and Casey Hall

(Reuters) -Chinese e-commerce firm PDD Holdings saw first-quarter net profit fall 47% to 14.74 billion yuan ($2.05 billion) as its domestic platform suffered from intense local competition and its international business was hit by global trade uncertainty.

U.S.-listed shares of the company fell more than 17%.

""[PDD’s] massive bottom line miss is due to much weaker than expected operating margin, likely impacted by U.S. tariffs,"" said Mscience analyst Vinci (EPA: ) Zhang.

Despite deep price cuts by retailers and government stimulus measures to boost spending, a prolonged property crisis in the world’s second-largest economy has cast a shadow over consumer spending in China, even on PDD’s Pinduoduo (NASDAQ: ), which has out-performed peers with its low-price focus.

""Slower domestic consumption, intensified competition, and global trade frictions are weighing on growth,"" said U.S. Tiger Securities analyst Bo Pei.

""Elevated costs reflect strategic promotional activities and advertising spend to support merchant sales, it’s aimed at supporting the platform’s long-term ecosystem health but sacrifices near-term profitability.""

China’s largest online e-commerce platforms - Alibaba (NYSE: ), Pinduoduo and JD.com - have been scrambling for a greater share of the domestic market, sparking a long-running price war to entice consumers to open their wallets.

Alibaba’s quarterly revenue also missed estimates, although JD.com notched a beat, buoyed by a government trade-in scheme focused on its strongest categories, including home appliances and electronics.

Meanwhile, a tit-for-tat tariff escalation between the U.S. and China, followed by a temporary 90-day de-escalation, has generated widespread uncertainty for global business Temu.

""Radical change in external policy environments such as tariffs has created significant pressure for our merchants,"" PDD chairman and co-ceo Chen Lei told analysts in a post-earnings call.

The U.S. earlier this month slashed tariff rates for goods from China valued at under $800 entering the country under the ""de minimis"" provision, a trade exemption leveraged by Temu to avoid tariffs and keep prices low.

""Our global business is working with merchants across regions to bring stable prices and abundant supply to strengthen our operations in the markets we serve,"" Chen said, reiterating Temu’s desire not to raise prices in the face of tariffs and its strategic shift to seeing more orders fulfilled by local merchants.

PDD reported revenue of 95.67 billion yuan ($13.30 billion) for the quarter ended March 31, compared with analysts’ average estimate of 102.51 billion yuan, according to data compiled by LSEG.

2025-05-27,06:36,"Goldman Sachs downgrades IMI to “neutral,” cuts EPS and sales outlook By Investing.com","Investing.com -- Goldman Sachs downgraded IMI Plc (LON: ) to ""neutral"" from ""buy"" and cut its 12-month price target to 2,120p from 2,220p, citing weaker short-cycle growth, foreign exchange headwinds, and subdued capital expenditure expectations across key markets.

In a note dated Tuesday, Goldman analysts revised their FY25 adjusted EPS forecast to 129.8p from 133.1p, placing it at the low end of IMI’s own guidance range of 129p–136p.

The downward revision reflects reduced expectations in organic sales growth, now forecast at 2.6% versus 5.3% previously, and reflects a broad-based slowdown across IMI’s core business segments.

The downgrade is attributed in part to a sharp decline in the U.S. ISM manufacturing PMI’s new order-to-inventory (NOI) ratio, which fell to 0.85 in March.

According to Goldman, this level has only been seen twice in the past 16 years and typically coincides with contractions in IMI’s Industrial Automation business, which is now expected to contract by 3% in FY25.

Process Automation’s outlook has also been tempered. Goldman now forecasts FY25 organic sales growth at 7.5%, down from 8.5%, citing lower capex expectations in 7 of the 8 end-markets tracked.

Although large orders in nuclear and LNG offered some offset, the general slowdown in customer investment has led to a 5% cut in forecast orders for FY25 and FY26.

In the Life Technology segment, growth expectations were also revised down. Life Science & Fluid Control is recovering slower than anticipated, while Transport continues to face declining demand.

Goldman projects a 0.7% organic growth for Life Technology in FY25, down from 3.6%. Transport, which is under strategic review by IMI, is now forecast to shrink by 7.8% in the same period.

The brokerage also identifies increased foreign exchange pressure as a significant factor, with FX expected to reduce FY25 earnings by 1.9%, reversing a previously neutral impact. Additionally, Goldman cut its estimate of M&A contribution to 0.5% from 0.8%.

Despite the earnings cuts, the FY25 group adjusted EBIT margin forecast remains unchanged at 20.1%, supported by a shift in revenue mix toward higher-margin segments. Still, Goldman revised FY25 sales, EBIT, and net income forecasts down by around 5%–6%.

Free cash flow estimates were also lowered by 9% for FY25 and 8% for FY26, citing reduced earnings and a £10 million increase in capex based on the company’s updated guidance.

While Goldman sees 10% upside to the revised price target, it noted that IMI shares have underperformed the broader European multi-industry average over the past three months.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/goldman-sachs-downgrades-imi-to-neutral-cuts-eps-and-sales-outlook-4064570

2025-05-27,06:26,Citi sees up to 8% downside for Stoxx 600 on Trump tariff risk By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- Citi analysts warned in a note Tuesday that European equities could face significant downside if President Trump’s tariff threats materialize.

The bank outlined the potential implications of a 50% tariff on European goods, a scenario the firm is treating as hypothetical for now but one that has already rattled markets.

While Trump said on Sunday that he has agreed to delay the 50% tariff on the European Union until July 9, Citi noted that the “surprise announcement on a possible 50% tariff on European goods” had triggered broad selling in European equities.

The Index could drop “c7-8% from here” if the tariff threats are enacted and priced in, according to Citi’s projections.

Earnings estimates for European companies have already started to reflect increased geopolitical risks.

“Analyst consensus forecasts for 2025E European EPS growth have fallen from +7% pre-Liberation day to c2% now,” Citi noted. That decline is said to be consistent with their prior modeling of the earnings impact from a 20% tariff.

However, should tariffs rise to 50%, Citi’s top-down models suggest EPS growth could deteriorate further.

“EPS growth could fall another 5-6% to c-4%, if 50% broad tariffs are implemented,” they warned. “This comes against the backdrop of the market pricing in c4% EPS growth over the next 12m.”

Citi emphasized that the uncertainty surrounding trade policy is already dragging down sentiment and could translate into more pronounced equity declines if the threats are realized.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/citi-sees-up-to-8-downside-for-stoxx-600-on-trump-tariff-risk-4064531

2025-05-27,06:21,"Singapore Airlines turbulence investigation not yet complete, ministry says By Reuters","SEOUL (Reuters) -Singapore authorities said on Tuesday that an investigation into a Singapore Airlines (OTC: ) flight last year that hit turbulence, injuring dozens of people and killing one, was still awaiting analysis of the plane’s weather radar systems.

A 73-year-old passenger died of a suspected heart attack in the incident, which occurred after flight SQ321 from London to Singapore encountered what the airline described as sudden, extreme turbulence while flying over Myanmar.

It was civil aviation’s first death linked to airplane turbulence in 25 years and put seatbelt practices in the spotlight. It also prompted calls from the airline industry for improved turbulence forecasting as experts warn severe weather patterns brought about by climate change could lead to more incidents.

An interim update of the investigation on Tuesday said that, in addition to the death, 79 people were injured on the flight, which diverted to Bangkok with 211 passengers and 18 crew members aboard.

The short update from Singapore’s Transport Safety Investigation Bureau, part of the transport ministry, was released a week after the one-year anniversary of the May 21, 2024 incident.

The ministry said a final report would be issued once the investigation is complete.

""Components of the aircraft’s weather radar system have been sent for examination and tests in the U.S.,"" the interim update said.

Global aviation guidelines call for an initial report within 30 days of an accident and a final one ideally within a year. Failing that, investigators should issue interim statements on each anniversary.

In a preliminary report last year, the transport ministry said rapid changes in gravitational forces over 4.6 seconds resulting in an altitude drop of 178 feet (54 m) likely caused passengers and crew to become airborne and then fall, causing the injuries.

Passengers on the flight, speaking after the incident, said that crew and those not strapped in left the floor or their seats and slammed into the cabin ceiling, cracking it in places.

2025-05-27,06:12,Nvidia earnings to reveal hit from US export curbs on China By Reuters,"By Arsheeya Bajwa

(Reuters) - Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) investors will look for definitive answers on how much U.S. chip curbs on China will cost the company when it reports results on Wednesday, even as a pullback in other regulations is expected to open up new markets.

In a fresh effort to stymie Beijing’s access to cutting-edge technology, the Trump administration last month put export limits on Nvidia’s H20 chip - a move the company said would result in $5.5 billion in charges.

CEO Jensen Huang, who pegged the market for AI chips in China at roughly $50 billion next year, said last week Nvidia had walked away from $15 billion of sales in the country after the curbs.

Nvidia does not break out sales for the H20, the only AI chip it was allowed to sell to China, a market which accounted for 13% of its revenue last year.

""The primary question around results and guidance is can Nvidia lift sales enough to offset the loss of H20 or China business,"" Wedbush analysts said ahead of the earnings report.

While sources have told Reuters that company is planning to launch a new AI chipset for China based on Nvidia’s latest generation Blackwell architecture, the uncertainty of losing its China business has dented its stock.

The stock has already been under pressure from concerns about mounting AI infrastructure costs. It was down 2% this year, a far cry from their nearly three-fold gain last year.

""China will probably be the biggest swing factor for Nvidia’s quarter,"" said D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria.

The company is expected to report that first-quarter revenue surged 66.2% to $43.28 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.

Susquehanna analysts estimated the restrictions impacted the last three weeks of the April quarter, costing Nvidia about $1 billion in sales.

For the rest of the year, lost revenue could amount to as much as $4.5 billion per quarter, they said. Wedbush estimated the quarterly hit at $3 billion to $4 billion.

Adjusted gross margin is expected to drop more than 11 percentage points to 67.7%. The write-downs related to H20 shipments could translate to a gross margin hit of up to 12.5%, Wedbush said.

Nvidia CEO Huang recently called U.S. semiconductor curbs on China ""a failure,"" saying they have only pushed Chinese rivals such as Huawei to speed up development of homegrown chips.

NEW REGIONS

Washington, however, has said it is going to modify a Biden-era export curb called the AI diffusion rule that sought to curb exports of sophisticated AI chips by dividing the world into three tiers, with China blocked entirely.

This easing could open up new geographies of growth for Nvidia including the Middle East, though analysts say the region’s revenue contribution in the near term will be small.

As part of U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade deals with some Gulf countries, Nvidia has said it would sell hundreds of thousands of AI chips to Saudi Arabia, including 18,000 of its latest ""Blackwell"" chips to a startup owned by the country’s sovereign wealth fund.

After months of worries that investment in AI from large cloud providers was stalling, Nvidia investors have found confidence in pledges from companies including Alphabet (NASDAQ: )’s Google to keep spending.

Still, the quarters of blowout beats may be over for the company. In its last fiscal year, Nvidia beat Wall Street’s quarterly revenue estimates by 4.9% on average. It delivered quarterly sales that was 12.5% above estimates in the fiscal year preceding that.

""I don’t think investors expectations are very high as we go into it (results),"" said Ivana Delevska, chief investment officer of Spear Invest, which holds Nvidia shares in an actively managed exchange-traded fund.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/nvidia-earnings-to-reveal-hit-from-us-export-curbs-on-china-4064495
2025-05-27,06:09,"Texas poised to enforce age verification on Apple, Google app stores By Reuters","By Stephen Nellis

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -A bill that requires Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: )’s Google to verify the age of users of their app stores could become law this week in Texas, putting the second-most-populous state in the U.S. at the center of a debate over whether and how to regulate the use of smartphones by children and teenagers.

Senate Bill 2420 would require app store owners to verify the age of the user of a device, and, if that user is below the age of 18, require parental consent to download apps or make in-app purchases. Utah was the first U.S. state to pass a similar law earlier this year, and U.S. lawmakers have also introduced a federal bill.

The Texas bill is awaiting Governor Greg Abbott’s signature after receiving super-majority approval from both houses of the Texas legislature. Another bill, which has not yet passed the state legislature, would restrict social media apps to users over 18.

Age limits and parental consent for social media apps are one of the few areas of wide consensus in America, with a Pew Research poll in 2023 finding that 81% of Americans support requiring parental consent for children to create social media accounts and 71% support age verification before using social media.

The mental health effect of social media on children has become a growing global concern, with dozens of U.S. states suing Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) and the U.S. Surgeon General issuing an advisory calling for safeguards for children. Australia last year banned social media for children under 16, with other countries such as Norway also considering new rules.

How to implement age restrictions has caused a conflict between Meta, the owner of Instagram and Facebook, and Apple and Google, which own the two dominant app stores in the U.S.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg last year said during a U.S. Senate hearing that he believed parents should not ""have to upload an ID or proof they are a parent in every single app that their children use. The easier place to do this is in the app stores themselves.""

Meta declined to comment for this story.

Child online safety groups that backed the Texas bill have also long argued for app store age verification, saying it is the only way to give parents effective control over children’s use of technology.

""The problem is that self-regulation in the digital marketplace has failed, where app stores have just prioritized the profit over safety and rights of children and families,"" Casey Stefanski, executive director for the Digital Childhood Alliance, told Reuters.

Apple and Google opposed the Texas bill, saying it imposes blanket requirements to share age data with all apps, even when those apps are uncontroversial.

""If enacted, app marketplaces will be required to collect and keep sensitive personal identifying information for every Texan who wants to download an app, even if it’s an app that simply provides weather updates or sports scores,"" Apple said in a statement.

Google and Apple each have their own proposals that involve sharing age range data only with apps that require it, rather than all apps.

""We see a role for legislation here,"" said Kareem Ghanem, senior director of government affairs and public policy at Google, told Reuters. ""It’s just got to be done in the right way, and it’s got to hold the feet of Zuckerberg and the social media companies to the fire, because it’s the harms to kids and teens on those sites that’s really inspired people to take a closer look here and see how we can all do better.""",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/texas-poised-to-enforce-age-verification-on-apple-google-app-stores-4064468

(HE: ). rose on Monday after the Finnish forestry company announced it would discontinue work on a planned biofuels refinery in Rotterdam, ending all engineering and site-related activity tied to the project.

UPM said the decision came after extended technical, commercial and strategic evaluations. The company currently operates a single bio-refinery in Lappeenranta, Finland.

Stifel in a note said the cancellation is a positive development. They noted that UPM’s biofuels operations have underperformed relative to expectations, and halting the Rotterdam project improves medium-term cash flow visibility.

Stifel said the move signals a sharper focus on profitable growth rather than expansion for its own sake.

UPM said it will continue to pursue growth in biofuels through lower-capex alternatives.

That includes evaluating the potential to debottleneck its Lappeenranta facility and further capitalize on market demand for crude tall oil (CTO)-based biofuels.

The company also plans to continue efforts to qualify CTO-derived fuels as sustainable aviation fuel and to develop proprietary technologies that broaden its feedstock base.

Following sneaker-maker Skechers’ take-private deal earlier this month, dealmakers expect other retailers to clinch their own deals to go private in the near-term, especially if Trump does not soon settle on a more stable trade policy, according to interviews with 10 investment bankers and M&A lawyers.

Retailers in particular have been hard-hit by Trump’s rapidly shifting tariff announcements, and are frustrated with an inability to provide earnings guidance.

Skechers was in talks with investment firm 3G Capital long before its market value began a precipitous drop from an all-time high of around $11.85 billion on January 30 - the day before the White House announced its first round of tariffs against China - according to two people familiar with the matter.

The flood of tariff announcements beat the company’s value down to about $7.4 billion by the end of April. Skechers, which manufactures most of its goods in China and Vietnam, pulled its 2025 earnings guidance around that time, citing “macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from global trade policies.""

Skechers is majority-owned by the Greenberg family. The tariff turmoil made the idea of going private all the more attractive to the Greenbergs, said the sources, who asked not to be named because the negotiations were private.

The company announced plans on May 5 to sell to 3G Capital in a so-called take-private deal for about $9.4 billion. Selling to a privately held firm like 3G removes the company’s shares from public exchanges, which effectively shields its earnings from public scrutiny and protects its valuation from unpredictable market swings.

Skechers declined to comment.

Other retailers are already in talks to sell to investment firms and other companies, the sources said.

“The breakneck pace of the instability, the volatility, and the macro changes have made board members start thinking, ‘Would it be better to manage this business in private where we don’t have to report out to the street with the same quarterly cadence and where we can control operational, financial, and capital allocation decisions in private?’” said Kurt Anthony, head of consumer and retail investment banking for the Americas at UBS.

TAKE-PRIVATE TARGETS

Few industries have been hit harder by Trump’s tariffs than retailers, many of which manufacture most of their goods overseas and have had to pull earnings guidance amid fickle foreign policy. After de-escalating his trade war, Trump on Friday levied fresh threats against Apple (NASDAQ: ) and the European Union, sending markets that had mostly recovered from his initial trade moves reeling once again. The S&P Retail Select Industry index had fallen by 6% year-to-date as of Friday’s market close, while the broader had fallen 1.1% in the same period.

“There are a lot of CEOs that reached out to me and said ’I’m tired, I love what I do, but maybe it’s time I go private,’” said Jamie Salter, CEO of Authentic Brands Group. The company, which owns the intellectual property of several apparel companies including Reebok and Champion, acquired Dockers’ IP from Levi’s (NYSE: ) last week. “I think you’re going to see good companies either stay private, or go private.”

And companies where a family - as in the case of Skechers - or a single investor has a controlling stake can sign these deals faster and more easily than those that need broad shareholder approval.

Investment bankers and advisers pointed to other retailers with similar ownership structures as potential take-private targets: Under Armour (NYSE: ) where founder and CEO Kevin Plank has majority voting control, Columbia Sportswear (NASDAQ: ) Company where chairman and CEO Timothy Boyle and his family are the biggest shareholders, and Birkenstock (NYSE: ) with private equity firm L Catterton holding a majority stake. Under Armour, Columbia, Birkenstock and L Catterton did not respond to requests for comment.

In Skechers’ case, navigating the market uncertainty in private made sense to father-son duo Robert Greenberg, chairman and CEO, and Michael Greenberg, president, said the two people familiar with the family’s thinking. And a buyer like 3G, which has held some investments for over a decade, can afford to ride out short-term tariff and market volatility compared with traditional private equity firms that tend to hold their investments for a handful of years, the people said.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/analysisretailers-pummeled-by-trumps-trade-war-entertain-more-takeprivate-offers-4064461
2025-05-27,05:59,Japan auction of 40-year debt in focus for signs of sovereign fiscal stress By Reuters,"By Rocky Swift and Junko Fujita

TOKYO (Reuters) -The markets will be closely watching an auction of Japan’s longest tenor bonds on Wednesday to see if debt investors will continue to put up with the worsening finances of major government issuers.

Bond yields, particularly on the long end, have surged around the world in recent weeks as concerns mount over fiscal deficits.

Heavily indebted Japan’s government bonds are the ""canary in the global duration coalmine,"" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote last week after poor demand at a sale of 20-year bonds.

JGBs rallied sharply in the afternoon on Tuesday after Reuters reported that the Ministry of Finance may tweak its issuance plan to reduce issuance of super-long bonds.

That would come too late to impact Wednesday’s sale of about 500 billion yen ($3.5 billion) of 40-year bonds, whose yields touched a record high 3.675% last week, along with an all-time high for 30-year paper and a multi-decade peak for 20-year debt.

Long-dated debt has sold off on concerns tax cuts and a chaotic roll-out of sweeping tariffs by U.S. President Donald Trump will stoke inflation and impel governments to spend more. That has driven up the term premium - the extra yield offered to buyers in exchange for locking up their money in longer-dated securities.

Moody’s on May 17 became the last major rating agency to strip the United States of its top grade because of growing debt, which stands at about 124% of GDP.

But the situation is more precarious in Japan, where the debt ratio is double that amount and the central bank has slashed its bond buying to support the economy.

Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato warned that higher rates could further imperil Japan’s finances and pledged ""appropriate"" management of its debt.

What sets Japan apart from other markets is that its finance chiefs are directly addressing the dramatic runup in longer yields and acting to prop them up, said Shoki Omori, chief desk strategist at Mizuho Securities.

""If you look at other places in the world, say Europe or the U.S., I don’t think any policymakers are saying that they will support the long end,"" Omori said. ""If you look at the U.S., it’s the opposite.""

A reduction in issuance of 20-, 30- or 40-year JGBs would be counterbalanced by increased sales of shorter-dated debt, sources told Reuters, meaning overall issuance for the fiscal year would remain at 172.3 trillion yen.

The change would be positive for super-long bonds, but now attention turns to how much the MOF will scale things back by, said Shinichiro Kadota, head of Japan FX and rates strategy at Barclays Securities Japan.

""A smaller-than-expected reduction could be a cue for a sell-off,"" Kadota said.

The MOF may look to pre-COVID levels of super-long supply, which would be about 3 trillion yen less than current levels, Societe Generale (OTC: ) analysts said in a note.

The trigger for last week’s sell-offs in JGBs was an auction of 20-year debt that saw the tail - the difference between the lowest and average accepted prices - reach its widest since 1987, signalling weak demand.

The 40-year sale on Wednesday won’t have a tail due to a difference in auction procedure, but traders may watch the bid-to-cover ratio, with higher numbers indicating healthier demand. The longest tenor bonds have averaged ratios of 3 since they were first sold in 2007.

Mizuho’s Omori said the auction is likely to go well due to speculation over MOF issuance tweaks, but it may be a short-term fix.

""There’s not going to be many other catalysts for long-term yield support,"" he said.

2025-05-27,05:36,Xiaomi reports record first-quarter revenue as it launches new electric SUV By Reuters,"By Che Pan and Brenda Goh

BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s Xiaomi (OTC: ) on Tuesday reported record first-quarter revenue and profit, as the company said its ongoing shift towards higher-end products from smartphones to home appliances was already paying off.

Revenue for the quarter ended March 31 was 111.3 billion yuan ($15.48 billion), up 47% year-on-year and beating the 107.6 billion yuan average of 17 analyst estimates compiled by LSEG.

Adjusted net profit rose above 10 billion yuan for the first time, jumping 65% year-on-year to 10.7 billion yuan, ahead of the average estimate of 8.96 billion yuan, according to LSEG data.

Xiaomi President Lu Weibing told a conference call with reporters that Xiaomi’s strategy to focus on high-end products had yielded positive results.

The world’s third-largest smartphone maker, whose product lines also extend to cars, announced its latest electric SUV, the YU7, last week, which it will start selling in July. Lu said feedback on the YU7 indicated it could have a broader target market than its previous model, the SU7. The company did not disclose the price of the YU7 but suggested its better configurations should make the car 60,000-70,000 yuan more expensive than Tesla (NASDAQ: )’s best-selling Model Y, which is expected to be its strongest competitor and is priced from 263,500 yuan ($36,574).

Xiaomi’s EV business generated 18.1 billion yuan in revenue during the first quarter, delivering 75,869 SU7 sedans. It posted an adjusted net loss related to its EV and other new initiatives of 0.5 billion yuan. Its new EV orders have fallen since a fatal highway crash at the end of March involving an SU7 in driving-assistance mode, analysts have said.

Its problems have been compounded by customer complaints of false advertising. Xiaomi apologised earlier this month for ""not clear enough"" marketing. Still, the company’s shares have rebounded since April, giving it a market value of about $170 billion, higher than the roughly $161 billion commanded by BYD (SZ: ), China’s biggest EV maker, LSEG data show.

Xiaomi’s first-quarter global smartphone shipments rose 3% from a year earlier to 41.8 million handsets, ranking it third globally, with a market share of 14.1%, according to its latest financial report citing data from researcher Canalys.

2025-05-27,03:20,"Ahead of trade talks, Brussels seeks detail on firms’ US spending By Reuters","By Victoria Waldersee and Christina Amann

BERLIN (Reuters) - European Union policymakers have asked the EU’s leading companies and CEOs to swiftly provide detail of their U.S. investment plans, according to two sources familiar with the matter, as Brussels prepares for trade talks with Washington.

Members of the Confederation of European Business, also known as BusinessEurope, an alliance of 42 federations across the region, received a survey from the European Commission on Monday. It requested information on upcoming U.S. investments with an instruction to respond as soon as possible, one source said.

A similar note seeking information on investment plans for the next five years was sent to the 59-person European Roundtable for Industry, a second source said, with a note that the request came personally from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

The roundtable’s members include the CEOs of companies ranging from chip equipment maker ASML (AS: ) to chemicals group BASF to software company SAP, as well as automakers BMW (ETR: ) and Mercedes-Benz (OTC: ).

BusinessEurope’s members include employer and industry associations representing an equally wide range of companies, notably Germany’s auto sector, as well as the aerospace and pharmaceutical industries.

BusinessEurope confirmed it had been contacted to assist with collecting the most recent data on European investment in the U.S. to demonstrate the importance of EU-U.S. economic ties.

The European Roundtable for Industry did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while the Commission declined to comment.

The sources asked not to be named because they were not authorised to speak publicly on the issue.

UNCERTAINTY SAPS INVESTOR APPETITE

The Commission, which oversees trade policy for the 27-nation European Union, is stepping up efforts to secure a deal with the United States to end U.S. import tariffs on EU goods, or at least prevent any increases.

The Commission is trying to establish what might satisfy U.S. President Donald Trump, having offered a deal in which both sides move to zero tariffs on industrial goods, and the EU buys more soybeans, arms and liquefied .

Trump has made clear a chief goal of his tariffs is to re-industrialise the United States, towards which European corporate investment could contribute.

Some of the biggest investment announcements from Europe so far have come from the pharmaceutical sector, with Swiss pharma companies Roche and Novartis (SIX: ) pledging $50 billion and $23 billion respectively. France’s Sanofi (NASDAQ: ) has said it wants to invest at least $20 billion through 2030.

However, further plans are under threat by Trump’s executive order on drug pricing, Roche flagged earlier in May.

At least seven other European companies have said they would increase investments in the U.S., but gave no specific details on spending plans, a Reuters review of releases and executive comments on earnings conference calls over the last two months shows.

A survey by Germany’s Chamber of Commerce and Industry this month found that 24% of companies planned higher investments in the U.S. in the coming year, but 29% were reducing their investments.

An industry association source speaking on condition of anonymity said the uncertainty caused by Trump’s volatile policy announcements had reduced interest in U.S. investment.

2025-05-27,03:09,Analysis-Europe’s defence companies scramble for workers as business booms By Reuters,"By Michael Kahn, Christoph Steitz, Dominique Patton

VELKA BITES, Czech Republic/FRANKFURT/PARIS (Reuters) -Pavel Cechal reckons the Czech company he works for could easily generate more business for its missile and drone engines to double its workforce, if only he could find the staff.

His dilemma is shared by many defence companies in Europe, where governments are ramping up spending on ammunition, tanks and other arms in response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s warnings that they should not rely so much on Washington.

Cechal is vice president of operations at PBS Group, whose production facility in Velka Bites, a two-hour drive from Prague, employs 800 people. He is looking for more.

""If they were available on the labour market we would hire most of them immediately. We have the business for it,"" he told Reuters, adding the firm had raised wages by 8% last year and plans another 10% hike in 2025 to attract talent.

""We are now hiring at all levels of the company.""

While the bloc’s 800 billion euro ($896 billion) defence spending push is expected to create hundreds of thousands of jobs over the next decade, the specially trained AI engineers, data scientists, welders and mechanics required are in short supply.

Reuters spoke to more than a dozen companies, recruiters and workers who said that along with hiking wages and benefits, arms makers are poaching from other sectors and seeking potential recruits among local pupils and students.

PBS Group has taken a step beyond cooperation with schools and universities, Milan Macholan, chief executive of the Velka Bites production facility said: ""We also started our own training school where we generate our own employees.""

Since Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, 78% of EU military procurement spending has gone outside the bloc, with the U.S. alone securing 63%, European Commission data show, partly because Europe’s defence sector is fragmented between states.

The EU plans to move a big chunk of that procurement to Europe and hopes its new Union of Skills training and hiring strategy will help fill the defence recruitment gap. In Russia, meanwhile, hiring by the well-funded arms sector is causing labour shortages elsewhere.

COMPETITIVENESS CONCERNS

Franco-German company KNDS, which manufactures the CAESAR self-propelled howitzer used in Ukraine, has expanded shifts at the company’s main production site in Bourges in central France and is boosting hiring by 50% annually.

Recruitment remains a key issue, said Nicolas Chamussy, managing director of KNDS France, adding that there was a limit to how much they could hike salaries.

""Don’t forget that we’re in a war economy, but we’re also in an economic war. If our wages increase in an uncontrolled way, we’ll be less competitive,"" he said.

AI experts who can develop autonomous weapons systems as well as people with expertise in products made in small volumes are in particular demand, industry participants said.

""We’re not going to manufacture a CAESAR in the same way as a Peugeot (OTC: ) 308. We have to master very, very specific know-how which requires very particular skills. And those are rare on the job market,"" said KNDS spokesperson Gabriel Massoni.

A boost in defence spending to 3% of GDP from the current NATO target of 2% would require as many as 760,000 new skilled workers in Europe, management consultant firm Kearney said in a recent report.

""Defence policy independence in Europe would only be possible if the local share of defence spending were to increase dramatically, which in turn could further exacerbate personnel shortages,"" Kearney partner Guido Hertel wrote in the report.

Rheinmetall (ETR: ) -- Europe’s largest ammunition maker -- plans to increase its workforce by around 29%, or up to 9,000, by 2028, primarily with product developers, engineers, welders and electronics technicians, it told Reuters.

Submarine and frigate-builder Thyssenkrupp (ETR: ) Marine Systems is seeking up to 1,500 workers for its shipyard in Wismar, northern Germany. It is scouring trade fairs but says shortages of STEM experts trained in mathematics, IT or sciences are a challenge, a view shared by Leonardo in Italy.

""In the past, the fact that we offered secure, quality contracts was enough to guarantee our leadership, but today young people favour other sectors over industry,"" said the aerospace and defence firm, which is looking to universities and technical schools.

Godefroy Jordan, general manager at Headhunting Factory, a Paris-based recruiter, specialises in finding mechanics, systems engineers and technicians for some of France’s 4,000 small and medium-sized defence industry suppliers.

""The people we’re targeting are in jobs where they’ve never been headhunted, they don’t even have a CV,"" Jordan told Reuters. ""When we call them, they think it’s a scam.""

""This isn’t a problem of finances; it’s a human resources problem because the skills aren’t there,"" he added.

AUTO WORKERS IN DEMAND

Emrullah Karaca, who has worked at the soon-to-be-closed Gifhorn plant of auto supplier Continental for 25 years, is pondering a switch to Rheinmetall, which operates a factory around 50 km (30 miles) north.

But the father of three, who has trained to become a machine operator specialised in plastics technology, was also considering other options without the three-hour commute.

""For 25 years I’ve had the luxury of ... getting to work within five minutes,"" he said.

Auto industry struggles have helped Czech ammunition and shell producer STV Group recruit some of the more than 200 people it aims to add to its Vysoke Myto facility 155 km (96 miles) from Prague by the middle of next year, its chairman, David Hac, said.

""With the situation in the automotive industry worsening, we are now, for the first time in a long time, in a situation where we can choose a little among the people.""

Oliver Doerre, CEO of German sensor and radar maker Hensoldt, told Reuters the company welcomed former auto workers because they are used to just-in-time manufacturing.

""That’s where we hope to gain expertise to support us on this path towards serial production, towards scaling up production,"" he said.

2025-05-27,02:35,Saab CEO urges EU countries to get defence projects off the ground By Reuters,"By Niklas Pollard

KARLSKOGA, Sweden (Reuters) -Defence group Saab’s CEO on Tuesday urged European governments to step up getting EU-backed projects off the ground and said a military spending boom was only just beginning.

The Swedish defence company is riding the biggest boom in demand since the end of the Cold War as Europe scrambles to re-arm in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and signs U.S. priorities may be shifting away from the region.

""I think we are only in the beginning of the spending,"" Saab CEO Micael Johansson said during a presentation at the company’s plant in Karlskoga, central Sweden. Saab makes a wide range of military gear including fighter jets, surveillance systems, missiles and submarines.

""I think Europe will create more and more respect the more we take our own responsibility,"" he added. ""Spending more (on) European (defence) is absolutely a trend I believe will be valid going forward.""

The European Union on Tuesday approved the creation of a 150 billion-euro ($170.7 billion) EU arms fund to provide loans for defence projects, with a strong ""buy European"" element.

""The next hugely important step is to quickly get going,"" Johansson told Reuters. ""The countries have to step forward and say ’we want to take the lead here’.""

The company reiterated its 2023-2027 targets for organic sales growth of around 18% with operating income rising even more. Johansson said the goals would be revisited, probably next year, with growth set to continue well beyond 2027.

Saab last updated its financial targets in February.

Its order intake last year set a new record while its shares have doubled since the turn of the year, hitting a new all-time-high this week.

2025-05-27,00:02,Tesla misses out on European EV growth as Model Y fails to revive sales By Reuters,"By Jesus Calero

(Reuters) -Tesla’s sales in Europe fell 49% in April from a year earlier, even though battery-electric car sales rose 27.8%, as the U.S. EV maker’s upgrade of its Model Y shows little sign of reviving the brand’s fortunes in the region.

Overall car sales in Europe dipped 0.3%, with the strongest growth coming from electric and plug-in hybrid cars, data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association ( ACEA (BIT: )) showed.

WHY IT’S IMPORTANT

Tesla (NASDAQ: )’s European sales fell for the fourth straight month, as a backlash against CEO Elon Musk’s political views combined with a tepid reception for the new Model Y and heightened competition from European and Chinese players.

Tesla’s European market share dropped to just 0.7% from 1.3% a year ago.

European carmakers are striving to cut costs amid stiff competition, U.S. tariffs on auto imports, and a slowing global economy, with the outlook uncertain despite eased U.S.-China trade tensions.

BY THE NUMBERS

April sales in the European Union, Britain and the European Free Trade Association fell to 1.07 million cars, following 2.8% growth in March, the ACEA data showed.

Registrations at Chinese state-owned SAIC Motor and Japan’s Mitsubishi rose 24.5% and 22.1% respectively, while they fell 24.5% at Japan’s Mazda.

In the EU alone - not including Britain and the EFTA - total car sales have fallen 1.2% so far this year.

That is despite continued growth in demand for EVs, with registrations of battery-electric (BEV), plug-in hybrid (PHEV) and hybrid-electric (HEV) cars rising 26.4%, 7.8% and 20.8% respectively.

EV sales in the bloc - whether BEV, HEV or PHEV - accounted for 59.2% of passenger car registrations in April, up from 47.7% in the previous year.

Among the largest EU markets, total car sales in Spain and Italy increased by 7.1% and 2.7% respectively, while in France and Germany they dropped by 5.6% and 0.2%.

2025-05-26,22:32,Shares gain as markets weigh Trump’s tariff policies; long-dated bond yields fall By Reuters,"By Tom Wilson

LONDON (Reuters) -World shares gained on Tuesday as investors weighed up the latest tariff-related news, while long-dated U.S. Treasury yields were set for their biggest one-day fall since mid-April, mirroring a steep price rally in super-long Japanese debt.

After a weekend call with the European Commission’s president, U.S. President Donald Trump paused until July 9 his threatened tariff of 50% on goods entering the United States from the European Union.

European shares added 0.5%, supported by defence stocks, with UK shares climbing 0.8% to their highest in three weeks, following a holiday at the start of the week.

Wall Street shares, which also saw no trade on Monday due to a U.S. holiday, were set for solid gains too. were up 1.4%.

""Markets are getting more accustomed to Trump’s threats and now partly assume the full threat won’t immediately materialise,"" Deutsche Bank analysts wrote. ""There is certainly fear fatigue.""

Meanwhile, the yield on 30-year U.S. Treasuries, which affects U.S. government borrowing costs to home mortgage rates, fell as much as 8 basis points to 4.9572%, their lowest in a week.

The 30-year yields - at the epicentre of the market sell-off in April following Trump’s initial raft of tariffs - are still just below 5%, near their highest since October 2023.

The move mirrored a near-20 basis point fall in yields for Japanese 30-year debt that came after a Reuters report on Tuesday that Tokyo will consider trimming issuance of the super-long bonds, after recent sharp rises in yields.

""Debt sustainability is again creeping into investors minds,"" regarding heavily indebted Japan, said Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro for ING Research. ""That is a spillover from the concerns about the U.S.""

A major focus for investors this week will be results from Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) on Wednesday, where the AI bellwether is expected to report a 66% jump in first-quarter revenue.

Speeches from a slew of Federal Reserve policymakers and Friday’s U.S. core PCE price index are also due, which could provide clues on the outlook for U.S. rates.

In Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.4%, although Hong Kong’s outperformed with a gain of 0.4%.

LOSS OF CONFIDENCE

The dollar edged up 0.4% against a basket of currencies as investors took comfort from Trump’s tariff delay. Still, it was still heading for a fifth straight month of declines, which would mark its longest such losing streak since 2017.

The euro fell 0.4%, near a one-month high at $1.134725, while the yen weakened 0.6% to 143.71 per dollar.

Trump’s flip-flops on tariffs and concerns over the worsening U.S. deficit outlook have undermined sentiment towards U.S. assets and in turn been a drag on the dollar.

""A U.S. dollar regime change could be in the making in the long term after it appears to have peaked recently,"" said David Meier, an economist at Julius Baer (SIX: ).

""Erratic U.S. policymaking, the tense fiscal situation, and large external indebtedness, against the backdrop of the twin deficit, suggest that a weaker USD is the route of least resistance.""

And as the dollar loses some of its safe-haven appeal, investors have instead sought alternatives such as gold, sending prices to record highs this year.

Still, gold fell 1.4% to $3,298 an ounce as the dollar strengthened. [GOL/]

2025-05-26,19:58,U.S. stocks surge after Trump delays EU tariffs and consumer confidence jumps By Investing.com,"Investing.com-- U.S. stocks rose sharply Tuesday after President Donald Trump postponed plans to impose steep trade tariffs on the European Union, potentially averting a costly trade war. In addition, much stronger-than-expected U.S. consumer confidence data further helped propel stocks.

At 10:58 AM ET (15:58 GMT), the rose 500 points, or 1.2%, the index gained 89 points, or 1.5%, and the advanced 350 points, or 1.9%.

Wall Street was closed on Monday on account of the Memorial Day holiday.

Trump postpones 50% EU tariffs to July

Sentiment received a boost after Trump stated late Sunday that he had agreed to postpone his recently proposed 50% tariffs on goods from the EU to July 9, following a call with EU President Ursula von der Leyen.

Trump also said that his administration will begin trade talks in earnest with the EU, while Von Der Leyen also flagged improving relations with Washington.

The development offered some relief to markets, which were rattled on Friday by Trump threatening steep tariffs on the EU, along with Apple (NASDAQ: ).

This resulted in a losing week on Wall Street, with all three major indices falling more than 2% over the course of last week.

The July 9 deadline is also around when Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs are set to take effect, and the market’s remain focused on whether major U.S. trading partners can clinch agreements with Washington before the deadline.

Consumer confidence jumps by the most in four years

Consumer confidence saw a strong rebound in May, ending a five-month decline, largely driven by renewed optimism surrounding economic conditions and boosted further by the U.S.-China trade deal announced mid-month.

According to The Conference Board, the Consumer Confidence Index surged 12.3 points to 98.0, surpassing expectations of just 87.1. The sharp rise was fueled by improvements in both consumers’ short-term outlook—reflected in the Expectations Index jumping 17.4 points to 72.8—and perceptions of current conditions, with the Present Situation Index up 4.8 points to 135.9.

Senior Economist Stephanie Guichard noted that confidence was already improving ahead of the trade deal but accelerated in its aftermath, highlighting the deal’s positive impact on consumer sentiment.

More Fed speeches due

The U.S. president’s latest U-turn on EU tariffs reinforces how unpredictable his trade policies can be and undermines already fragile investor confidence in the U.S. economy.

An illustration of this uncertainty came with the orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods, which slumped in April, falling after the previous month’s sharp gains.

Orders for –items designed to last three years or more–fell 6.3% last month after a hefty revised 7.6% gain in March, the Commerce Department’s Census Bureau said on Tuesday.

Transportation equipment, down following four consecutive monthly increases, drove the decrease, falling $20.3 billion or 17.1 percent to $98.8 billion.

Investors are also likely Tuesday to carefully study commentary from Minneapolis Federal Reserve President and New York Fed President , adding to a series of comments from their colleagues last week.

Nvidia’s earnings loom large

The quarterly earnings season is largely at an end, with more than 95% of companies having already reported, with almost 78% having surpassed analyst expectations, according to FactSet.

Numbers from IT service management company Okta (NASDAQ: ) are due after the bell Tuesday, but most eyes this week will be on fiscal first quarter earnings from Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) after the close on Wednesday.

The company is considered a bellwether for global AI demand, especially in the chipmaking sector, and is sitting on a massive valuation spike over the past two years on this position.

Nvidia is expected to report bumper earnings, especially as Wall Street’s so-called AI Hyperscalers– its biggest customers– continued to spend heavily on AI over the past three months.

Elsewhere, Southwest Airlines (NYSE: ) stock rose after the carrier announced it will charge customers $35 for one checked bag and $45 for the second, bringing an end to its free luggage policy.

Salesforce (NYSE: ) stock gained after the Wall Street Journal reported that the software company is nearing an agreement to acquire Informatica in a deal valued at approximately $8 billion.

Crude awaits OPEC+ meeting

Oil prices slipped lower Tuesday, with investors wary ahead of a closely watched OPEC+ meeting that could provide key signals on future supply levels.

At 11:00 AM ET, Brent futures dropped 0.9% to $63.22 a barrel, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 1% to $60.55 a barrel.

The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, collectively known as OPEC+, are weighing the possibility of another production boost at their upcoming meeting later this week, Bloomberg News reported last week.

According to reports, one option under consideration is a supply increase of 411,000 barrels per day in July, though no final decision has been made.

OPEC+ has been in the process of unwinding output cuts, announcing additions to the market in May and June.

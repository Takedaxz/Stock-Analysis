2025-05-28,09:58,This is what matters most for today’s Nvidia earnings print: Mizuho By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- As Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) gears up to report earnings, Mizuho said investors are focusing less on this quarter’s guidance and more on long-term momentum tied to Blackwell and China updates.

“The clear conclusion from buyside feedback is: July qtr guide matters a lot less vs normal due to expected lost H20 revs in China,” the firm wrote.

Instead, “what will matter much more for stock and investor sentiment will be CEO / CFO commentary on call about a potential ramp in Blackwell GB200 rack system output and acceleration of rev-recog into Oct qtr onward.”

Mizuho flagged that despite a 23% rally since April 1, Nvidia shares are “essentially the exact same price as mid-June of last year,” making it a potential “catch-up trade” if the company can deliver anything above expectations on outlook, Blackwell, or new China revenues.

The firm’s analysts also said they are “starting to worry a bit with stock up so much past few weeks into the print... at upper $130 price level, the set-up definitely feels tougher vs the $100-110 level.”

Still, they added, “Gun to head, I would rather be long vs short the stock today into the print.”

Among the key drivers post-earnings are expected to be investor sentiment around the new B20 China GPU, seen as a potential offset to H20 losses; confirmation that gross margins are trending back toward “mid 70s in a few quarters,” and increased confidence in a 2H ramp for Blackwell.

Mizuho added, “Buyside EPS whisper for FY27 hearing $6,” with investors eyeing a 25–30x P/E range for valuation.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/this-is-what-matters-most-for-todays-nvidia-earnings-print-mizuho-4068117
2025-05-28,09:36,Goldman Sachs makes the strategic case for gold and oil in long-run portfolios By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- Goldman Sachs made the case for long-term investors to reconsider the roles of gold and oil in their portfolios, citing their historical effectiveness as hedges against inflation shocks and systemic risks.

In a recent note titled The Strategic Case for Gold and Oil in Long-Run Portfolios, Goldman Sachs analysts recommend a “higher-than-usual allocation to gold” and a “lower-than-usual allocation to oil” over a five-year horizon.

According to Goldman Sachs, “positive long-run allocations to gold and enhanced oil futures are optimal for investors seeking to minimize risk or tail losses for a given return.”

The bank highlights that gold serves as a hedge against waning fiscal and central bank credibility, while oil can protect against negative supply shocks.

Historically, “during any 12-month period when real returns were negative for both stocks and bonds, either oil or gold have delivered positive real returns.”

The call to overweight gold is based on two primary factors: “the high risk of shocks to U.S. institutional credibility (e.g., fiscal expansion, pressure on the Fed), and the central bank demand boost to gold.”

In contrast, the underweight recommendation for oil is driven by near-term supply dynamics. “High spare capacity... reduces the risk of 2025-2026 shortages,” Goldman wrote.

However, the bank also noted that “a sharp slowdown in non-OPEC supply growth from 2028 raises the risk of oil inflation shocks down the road,” justifying a continued, albeit limited, strategic allocation.

For tactical portfolios with a shorter time frame of zero to two years, Goldman recommends using “oil puts (or put spreads) to hedge against ongoing recession risks and to benefit from increasing oil supply.”",https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/goldman-sachs-makes-the-strategic-case-for-gold-and-oil-in-longrun-portfolios-4068042
2025-05-28,09:22,Tempus AI stock sinks following Spruce Point short report By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- Shares of Tempus AI (NASDAQ: TEM) tumbled 4% after the company was targeted in a short-seller report by Spruce Point. The report raised serious concerns about the integrity of Tempus AI’s product, the credibility of its management, and its financial reporting practices.

The Spruce Point report, which follows a forensic review of the precision medicine solutions company, criticized Tempus AI for the minimal revenue generated from its AI Applications product line, suggesting a disconnect between the company’s branding and its financial reality. In 2024, AI-related revenue was reported to be just $12.4 million, less than 2% of the company’s total revenue of $693.4 million. The prior year, AI revenue was only $5.5 million.

Moreover, the report highlighted concerns over Tempus AI’s leadership, noting CEO Eric Lefkofsky’s history with companies that experienced financial scandals, including bankruptcies and restatements. It also questioned the company’s partnerships and joint ventures, suggesting potential round-tripped sales and related party deals.

The report further scrutinized Tempus AI’s billing practices, indicating aggressive use of billing code 81479, known for minimal oversight and a high risk of abuse. This tactic could inflate revenue at the expense of patient care, with the report suggesting that Tempus AI and its acquired entity, Ambry, may prioritize revenue over clinical necessity.

In conclusion, Spruce Point warned investors of the company’s reliance on perceived equity value, aggressive accounting, and unsustainable practices. They projected a 50% – 60% potential downside risk to Tempus AI’s share price, advising extreme caution and close scrutiny of the company’s public statements. The sell-side consensus price target stands at $66.82 per share, which implies a mere 1% upside potential.

Investors reacted to the report by selling off shares, reflecting the market’s concern over the allegations made by Spruce Point.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/tempus-ai-stock-sinks-following-spruce-point-short-report-4068011
2025-05-28,09:17,"GameStop pulls the trigger, discloses $513 million Bitcoin investment By Investing.com","Investing.com -- GameStop Corp (NYSE: ) shares climbed over 2%, but pared back some gains premarket Wednesday, after the video game retailer disclosed a $513 million investment in bitcoin, a significant step in its strategy to diversify assets and strengthen its balance sheet. The company announced the acquisition of approximately 4,710 bitcoins in a regulatory filing, though it did not detail the timing of the purchases.

This marks GameStop’s first direct foray into cryptocurrency holdings since it signaled its intent to invest in digital assets earlier this year. The move echoes a growing trend among corporations looking to incorporate alternative asset classes amid persistent macroeconomic uncertainty.

The decision follows Bitcoin’s recent surge, with the world’s largest cryptocurrency trading between $107,000 and $112,000 over the past week, hitting a record high at $111,953.6. As digital assets gain broader acceptance, companies such as GameStop are exploring strategic exposure in efforts to hedge against inflation and position for long-term returns.

The purchase closely mirrors the approach of MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ: ), a former software firm that has evolved into a bitcoin-heavy investment vehicle. GameStop appears to be following a similar path as it attempts to reinvent its corporate identity beyond its traditional retail footprint.

The investment in bitcoin comes amid broader efforts by GameStop to recalibrate its operations after years of volatility. The company has emphasized digital growth, including initiatives to enhance its e-commerce platform and capitalize on consumer trends shifting away from physical game sales.

While the company has not disclosed the precise period during which the bitcoin purchases occurred, the filing aligns with guidance offered in March. At the time, GameStop indicated its intention to explore digital asset exposure as part of a renewed strategic alignment.

As traditional and digital asset markets continue to intersect, GameStop’s pivot highlights the increasing willingness of public companies to embrace non-conventional avenues for growth. The stock is now up 1.5% premarket, as investors weigh the risks and rewards of GameStop’s evolving business.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/gamestop-pulls-the-trigger-discloses-513-million-bitcoin-investment-4067988

2025-05-28,06:42,Wells Fargo: Time to trim U.S. small caps after recent rally By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- Wells Fargo analysts believe it is time for investors to reduce their exposure to U.S. small-cap equities following a strong rebound since early April.

“U.S. Small Cap Equities have performed on par with U.S. Large Cap Equities since the market bottomed on April 8,” the firm wrote, with both categories rising about 20% from April 8 through May 20.

The rally has been fueled by “the abatement of tariff fears; better-than-expected economic data; and an all-around solid earnings season,” according to Wells Fargo.

These factors have “reinvigorated market sentiment around U.S. Small Cap Equities.”

“We view the recent rally in U.S. Small Cap Equities as an attractive opportunity to trim the asset class back to recommended portfolio allocations,” added the bank.

Still, the firm maintains a neutral tactical rating on the asset class, cautioning that the rally may not be sustainable.

“It remains the case that tariffs have been more aggressive than we initially thought,” Wells Fargo warned, adding that “earnings revisions continue to deteriorate on higher-than-expected interest rates and tariff rates.”

While positives like “looming deregulation, lower short-term interest rates and a cyclical recovery in late 2025 into 2026” are supportive of small caps, these are balanced by persistent macro headwinds, according to Wells Fargo.

Given this environment, the bank recommends reallocating from small caps to other areas. “We continue to favor U.S. Large Cap and U.S. Mid Cap Equities,” the analysts wrote. “We would use this opportunity to trim small cap holdings back to long term target allocations, and reallocate into large- and mid-cap equities.”",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/wells-fargo-time-to-trim-us-small-caps-after-recent-rally-4067178
2025-05-28,06:21,Barclays sees upside in stocks as re-risking stays subdued By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- Barclays believes the path of least resistance for equities is still higher, supported by muted re-risking, resilient earnings, and favorable liquidity conditions.

Despite a market rebound in recent weeks, the firm notes that “mutual funds inflows stalled in May,” while hedge funds and CTAs remain “under-exposed to equities.”

According to Barclays, “retail buying showed only a modest pickup,” and although allocation to equities remains high, investor sentiment is cautious.

As a result, “systematic buying may help equities to keep grinding higher” as volatility stays contained.

The equity outlook is also being cushioned by improving fundamentals, according to the bank.

“Resilient earnings, a pick-up in buybacks activity and a steady rise in global M2 liquidity all favour equities,” Barclays said, even as concerns about U.S. debt sustainability temporarily flipped the equity-bond correlation negative.

Meanwhile, a rotation out of U.S. equities and into the rest of the world (RoW) appears to be gaining momentum.

“U.S. vs. RoW equity flows have started to turn and follow the dollar lower,” with global ex-U.S. equities “breaking out from their post-GFC range.”

While European investors haven’t sold U.S. assets aggressively, “U.S.-domiciled investors sold U.S. equities and bought into RoW equities last month.”

European equity demand “remains steady,” especially from domestic investors, and EM equities have also benefited from a weaker dollar. Japan saw equity inflows pick up, though fiscal concerns led to bond outflows.

Sector rotation trends are also said to suggest opportunity. “Cyclicals outperformed in May and saw inflows pick up,” Barclays said, while crowding remains low in EU exporters, autos, consumer cyclicals, energy, and AI plays.

Among the current market risks, Barclays lists potential “pain trades” as “higher equities, lower yields, higher USD, US>ROW, Cyclicals>Defensives, Growth>Value, and EU exporters>domestics.”",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/barclays-sees-upside-in-stocks-as-rerisking-stays-subdued-4067114
2025-05-28,03:48,"Nvidia earnings, new Stellantis CEO, Japanese bond auction","Investing.com - U.S. stock futures retreated slightly Wednesday ahead of key earnings from Nvidia, the tech giant which has been one of the main beneficiaries of the AI craze. Stellantis has appointed a new chief executive, and a poorly-received Japanese bond auction has raised concerns over demand for long-dated paper.

1. Nvidia’s quarterly earnings loom large

The marquee event Wednesday will be the release of quarterly earnings from Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), with the chip giant widely seen as a bellwether for the tech industry.

Nvidia releases its first-quarter results after the close, and is expected to report a 66% surge in revenue to just over $43 billion for the three months to April 31, both up substantially from last year.

The company is expected to have benefited greatly from sustained demand as Wall Street’s so-called AI hyperscalers continued to pour billions into data centers and cloud infrastructure.

That said, the focus is likely to be on Nvidia’s outlook, especially as the company grapples with stricter U.S. controls on chip sales to China. Uncertainty surrounding this major market looms large even as a pullback in other regulations is set to open up new markets.

A shift towards AI inference from training, which is less data intensive, as well as increased interest in less demanding AI models, also stand to dampen future chip demand.

Nvidia’s shares have tended to underperform after the company’s earnings over the past three quarters, given lofty expectations, and traders are bracing for industry-wide volatility, with defensive options contracts on a major semiconductor ETF drawing heavy attention.

2. U.S. futures slip ahead of Nvidia’s release

U.S. stock futures slipped slightly lower Wednesday, handing back some of the previous session’s strong gains ahead of the release of quarterly earnings from AI darling Nvidia.

At 03:40 ET (07:40 GMT), the traded 9 points, or 0.2%, lower dropped 30 points, or 0.1%, and fell 70 points, or 0.2%.

The main average posted strong gains on Tuesday, after President Donald Trump announced the postponement of a 50% tariff on European Union imports to July 9.

The blue chip rallied more than 700 points, or 1.8%, the broad-based gained 2%, and the tech-heavy advanced roughly 2.5%.

Investors are awaiting results from tech giant Nvidia [see above], while there are also earnings due from the likes of Macy’s (NYSE: ), Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE: ) and Dick’s Sporting Goods (F: ).

Investors will also keep an eye on the from the May Fed meeting, due later in the session, for clues of future monetary policy amid a period of economic uncertainty.

3. Japanese bond auction raises long-end concerns

Investors will also be watching developments in global bond markets after demand on Wednesday for Japan’s 40-year government bond auction was its lowest since November.

The auction’s bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges total bids against the amount of securities on offer, sank to 2.2 from 2.9 at the previous sale in March.

Long-end yields have surged worldwide in recent weeks on a heavy selloff in bonds as concern mounts over fiscal deficits, particularly in developed nations such as the U.S. and Japan.

The U.S. Treasury Department saw soft demand for a $16 billion sale of 20-year bonds last week, with investors worried about the country’s increasing debt burden as Congress debates a tax and spending bill that is expected to worsen the fiscal outlook.

It comes after Moody’s cut the United States’ sovereign rating from the top ""Aaa,"" adding to previous downgrades from Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor’s.

Wednesday sees the auction of shorter-dated U.S. two-year floating rate and five-year notes, as well as a German auction of 15-year Federal bonds.

4. Stellantis appoints new CEO

Auto giant Stellantis (NYSE: ) has appointed Antonio Filosa as its new Chief Executive Officer, succeeding Carlos Tavares, who departed in December following a steep drop in profits and sales, which raised concerns over his leadership.

Filosa will also be proposed for election to the Board at an upcoming Extraordinary Shareholder Meeting. Until then, he has been granted full CEO authority to ensure a smooth transition.

“The Board selected Antonio Filosa to be CEO based on his proven track record of hands-on success during his more than 25 years in the automotive industry, the depth and span of his experience around the world, his unrivalled knowledge of the Company and his recognized leadership qualities,” Stellantis wrote in the announcement.

Filosa has held several key leadership roles within Stellantis, most recently as Chief Operating Officer of the Americas.

5. Supply concerns help crude prices higher

Oil prices edged higher Wednesday, as concerns over potential new sanctions on Russia raised supply disruption fears, although trading ranges are tight ahead of a pivotal OPEC+ meeting later this week.

At 03:40 ET, futures climbed 0.6% to $63.96 a barrel, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 0.7% to $61.29 a barrel.

The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, collectively known as OPEC+, are weighing the possibility of another production boost at their upcoming meeting this weekend.

OPEC+ has been in the process of unwinding output cuts, announcing additions to the market in May and June.

As investors prepare for this increased supply, they also digested comments from U.S. President Donald Trump, who said that Russian President Vladimir Putin was “playing with fire”, and Trump is considering new sanctions against Russia.

This could put Russian energy flows at risk and disrupt the global oil supply.

Investors also await the American Petroleum Institute’s weekly , which has been delayed this week due to the U.S. Memorial Day holiday on Monday.

2025-05-28,03:10,sell Nvidia ahead of earnings? Here’s what our AI model says By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- The moment the market has been holding its breath for is finally upon us. Today, after the market closes, AI powerhouse (NASDAQ: ) is set to report its fiscal Q126 earnings amid conflicting signals.

On the one hand, rising US export curbs due to high commercial tensions with China, as well as dwindling sales in the country, could weigh on the stock. On the other hand, however, a fairly low expectation in comparison to past quarters will likely leave the giant’s top and bottom lines within reach.

Against the volatile backdrop, we turned to our proprietary AI model for stock picking - available exclusively for InvestingPro members for less than $10 a month - for clues on whether it might be time to buy the stock ahead of its bombastic earnings report.

In fact, those who followed our AI’s picks since its launch in 2023 notched a game-changing 226.7% gain on Nvidia stock alone in the period that spanned from November 2023 to December 2024.

The stock was then dropped from our AI’s list in December and went on to move sideways for a full quarter, shedding -1.9% since.

During that period, our AI flagged other buys instead, which helped our users notch a massive 96.7% since launch, nearly doubling their money in less than two years and outpacing the broader by 57.96%.

Some of these other picks that rallied while Nvidia stalled are:

Microchip Technology (NASDAQ: ): 27.62%

Walt Disney Company (NYSE: ): 23.73%

MKS Instruments (NASDAQ: ): 22.79%

Axcelis Technologies (NASDAQ: ): 21.50%

Just to name a few...

Global investors also got their fair share of gains during the period, with names such as:

Thyssenkrupp (OTC: ) (Germany): 149.7%

Indra Sistemas (BME: ) SA (OTC: ): 112.18%

Iveco (BIT: ) (Italy): 96.47%

Now, with Nvidia earnings set for release tonight, our AI’s answer to whether this is the right time to buy the stock is not yet, for Nvidia is not part of our latest list of stock picks for May.

Does this mean that the stock will not do well in its earnings?

Well, not necesarily. What it really implies is that, according to a compilation of more than 150 investment-grade models, our AI found 15 other better bets for the month based on their fundamentals and chose them instead, signaling a better risk-return proposition for these stocks.

With the list for June on its way in just a few days, a good report on the fundamental side could also turn our AI model’s favor to the stock again.

Pro members get these picks first, with notifications on the first trading day of each month.

But how does our AI model actually work?

At the start of each month, our AI refreshes each strategy with up to 20 stock picks. These selections are based on a blend of more than 150 well-established financial models.

Some stocks are added, others stay on, and a few are dropped, reflecting how the AI evaluates their medium-term growth potential.

Performance is then tracked using equal weighting across all the stocks in the strategy. You don’t have to mirror that weighting exactly, but it gives a clear picture of how effective the model is at identifying opportunity across the board.

At the end of the day, stock picking is still a game of probabilities. But the key isn’t just finding winners—it’s knowing when to move on from the ones that no longer stack up.

Since launch, the model has done just that—delivering more than a few standout success stories along the way.

In fact, our backtests suggest that investors who follow the strategies over the long run will get even better results. See below:

These developments come in the wake of President Trump’s March 6 executive order, which established the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile.

The Bitcoin 2025 conference has attracted significant attention, with industry leaders and policymakers discussing the future of digital assets.

PDD’s weak print comes just a week after ecommerce major Alibaba’s earnings underwhelmed.

Concerns over deflation largely offset a strong showing from Xiaomi, which clocked a record first quarter profit. Xiaomi’s shares rose 1.6% in Hong Kong trade.

Broader Asian markets mostly advanced, although gains were limited in several markets. Australia’s rose 0.2%, lagging its regional peers as mildly stronger than expected raised some doubts over when the Reserve Bank of Australia will cut interest rates next.

“I told Canada, which very much wants to be part of our fabulous Golden Dome System, that it will cost $61 Billion Dollars if they remain a separate, but unequal, Nation, but will cost ZERO DOLLARS if they become our cherished 51st State,” Trump said in a post on Truth.social, claiming that Canada was “considering the offer.”

Trump’s comment comes after Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney last week expressed some interest in investing in the Golden Dome project, which is slated to cost about $175 billion.

Trump’s comments on Canada’s sovereignty are the latest in the president’s claims that Canada could become the 51st U.S. state- a claim that has been categorically rejected by Canada.

A spokesperson for Carney reiterated the country’s sovereignty, according to a comment carried by the Financial Times.

Canada and the U.S. already have a defense agreement– the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), which includes measures to detect ballistic missile attacks.

Trump’s proposed Golden Dome system plans to establish interceptors in space to protect the U.S. against advanced threats such as intercontinental ballistic missiles, hypersonic missiles, and long-range cruise missiles.

The suit alleges that Tesla (NASDAQ: ) CEO Musk, classified as a “special Government employee,” functioned as a de facto principal officer of DOGE, an agency created by executive order without congressional authorization, and wielded sweeping authority over federal spending, personnel, and regulations.

The plaintiffs claimed Musk and DOGE unilaterally dismantled agencies, terminated federal contracts, and accessed sensitive systems in violation of the Constitution’s Appointments Clause, the judge stated in a court filing.

In a 42-page opinion, Judge Tanya S. Chutkan denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss the case against Musk and DOGE, allowing the states’ ultra vires claims to move forward. The court found the DOGE entity lacked a statutory or constitutional basis and that Musk’s alleged conduct exceeded lawful bounds.

However, the court dismissed claims against Trump in his official capacity, citing established precedent barring courts from enjoining the president’s discretionary duties.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/elon-musk-must-face-lawsuit-over-his-role-in-doge-under-trump-judge-says-4066381
2025-05-27,20:07,"U.S. stocks steady ahead of Fed minutes, keenly-awaited Nvidia earnings By Investing.com","Investing.com-- U.S. stocks traded in a steady fashion Wednesday, as investors digested more corporate earnings ahead of the release of minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting as well as results from artificial intelligence major Nvidia.

At 09:35 ET (13:35 GMT), the rose 50 points, or 0.1%, the index gained 9 points, or 0.2%, and the climbed 40 points, or 0.2%.

Nvidia earnings awaited for more AI cues

Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) is set to report its first-quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday, with analysts expecting a strong print.

Nvidia is forecast to post earnings per share of $0.893 on revenue of $43.12 billion for the three months to April 30, both up substantially from last year, according to Investing.com data.

The chipmaker is expected to have benefited from outsized domestic demand, especially as its biggest customers– Wall Street’s so-called AI hyperscalers– continued spending billions on building more data center capacity.

That said, the focus will be on Nvidia’s outlook, which is likely to set the tone for the tech industry going forward in 2025. Investors will also be watching for comments on Nvidia’s China sales, as the company grapples with more U.S. export controls and increased competition in the country.

CEO Jensen Huang recently criticized the U.S. export restrictions, calling them a ""failure,"" and also forecast China becoming a $50 billion market in the coming years.

Elsewhere, Macy’s (NYSE: ) stock rose after the department store chain reported stronger than expected first-quarter results, while also lowering its full-year 2025 outlook to reflect the impact of tariffs, softer consumer discretionary spending, and increased promotional competition.

Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE: ) shares surged after the apparel retailer reported first-quarter earnings that beat expectations, despite slightly missing on revenue.

Dick’s Sporting Goods (F: ) stock gained after the sporting goods retailer reported better-than-expected first quarter results, with record sales and comparable store growth, while reaffirming its full-year 2025 outlook.

Okta (NASDAQ: ) stock plunged after the identity management software company’s cautious guidance amidst economic challenges caused investor unease.

Fed minutes due

Investors will also keep an eye on the from the May Fed meeting, due later in the session, for clues of future monetary policy amid a period of economic uncertainty.

Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari on Tuesday called for keeping interest rates steady until there is more clarity on how higher tariffs affect inflation, warning against ""looking through"" the impact of such supply price shocks.

The shock to the economy from President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs, and uncertainty over U.S. trade policy, are forcing central banks to decide whether to focus on fighting inflation or supporting economic activity, he said.

Crude gains on supply concerns

Oil prices rose Wednesday, as concerns over potential new sanctions on Russia raised supply disruption fears, although trading ranges are tight ahead of a pivotal OPEC+ meeting later this week.

At 09:35 ET, Brent futures climbed 1.2% to $64.36 a barrel, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 1.5% to $61.79 a barrel.

The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, collectively known as OPEC+, are weighing the possibility of another production boost at their upcoming meeting this weekend.

OPEC+ has been in the process of unwinding output cuts, announcing additions to the market in May and June.

As investors prepare for this increased supply, they also digested comments from U.S. President Donald Trump, who said that Russian President Vladimir Putin was “playing with fire”, and Trump is considering new sanctions against Russia.

This could put Russian energy flows at risk and disrupt the global oil supply.

Investors also await the American Petroleum Institute’s weekly inventory report, which has been delayed this week due to the U.S. Memorial Day holiday on Monday.

2025-05-27,08:23,JPM highlights top 6 European investment ideas for next 12–18 months By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- JPMorgan has laid out its top six investment ideas in Europe over the next 12 to 18 months, highlighting a range of sectors it expects to benefit from structural and policy-driven shifts.

First, the Wall Street giant’s strategists, led by Mislav Matejk,a maintain a bullish stance on European defense, citing “increased Defense spending, where European countries are set to shift from an average 2% Defense spending as a share of GDP towards 3.5% later this decade.”

While the group’s valuations appear stretched after strong recent gains, the strategists believe “earnings will deliver” and continue to view the sector as a structural buy.

The second opportunity is linked to Germany’s €500 billion infrastructure fund, which JPMorgan expects to support names across construction materials, industrials, and transportation.

The fund, set to be spent over 12 years, is seen as a key fiscal stimulus driver. Stocks in JPMorgan’s “Germany Whatever It Takes” basket are viewed as well-positioned to benefit from the rollout.

The basket includes stocks such as Siemens (ETR: ), UniCredit SpA (BIT: ), Rheinmetall (ETR: ), Vinci (EPA: ), Siemens Energy AG (ETR: ), and dozens of other stocks.

JPMorgan’s third idea centers on financials. While tactically cautious on banks due to falling rates, the bank sees medium-term upside driven by improving balance sheets, credit flow recovery, and declining cost of equity.

Insurance is also favored, with analysts staying Overweight on this subsector in the medium term, despite short-term valuation concerns.

The fourth theme focuses on beneficiaries of lower energy prices, especially in the chemicals sector. JPMorgan highlights that “chemicals are the only one of the EM-exposed Cyclicals which are starting to perform less poorly,” and reiterates its overweight stance made earlier this year.

Utilities and Telecoms make up the fifth category. JPMorgan sees opportunities in stocks offering high dividend yields, benefiting from higher grid spending and cash flow improvements.

“Our analysts are positive on RWE (LON: ), National Grid (LON: ), and Engie SA (EPA: ),” the note says, while Deutsche Telekom (ETR: ) and Orange SA (EPA: ) are highlighted within telecoms.

Finally, JPMorgan sees value in German small caps. The index has lagged large caps for several years, but the bank believes the underperformance could reverse as fiscal stimulus and industrial exposure provide support.

“MDAX appears attractively priced relative to and is underowned,” the strategists wrote.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/jpm-highlights-top-6-european-investment-ideas-for-next-1218-months-4064930
2025-05-27,07:54,JPMorgan shifts to bullish stance on crypto amid sector tailwinds By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- JPMorgan has turned bullish on digital assets, citing a range of positive catalysts that could support the sector through the rest of 2025.

“We turn more constructive on digital assets,” strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said in a Monday note, highlighting a change in stance after a period of lackluster performance from both CTAs and crypto hedge funds earlier this year.

One of the key drivers for the renewed optimism is the anticipated wave of institutional adoption. JPMorgan points to “additional buying from MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: ) and other Bitcoin-accumulating corporates.”

The Wall Street bank also points out positive policy developments, such as “more U.S. states allowing to be added to their strategic reserves” and the expected regulatory progress in crypto derivatives and stablecoins.

These changes, according to the bank, could induce “more confidence and greater participation by traditional institutional investors.”

While the sector has seen volatile returns—with digital assets down 17.9% in Q1 after a strong performance in 2024—the bank sees regulatory clarity and broadening use cases as critical tailwinds.

JPMorgan also forecasts a 10% projected return for digital assets, the highest among all alternative investment classes in its updated allocation model.

The more bullish view comes as JPMorgan moves alternatives to an Underweight position overall, cutting exposure to private equity, private credit, and real estate.

In contrast, the bank has upgraded digital assets to an Overweight alongside hedge funds and traditional public equities.

Despite the renewed interest, crypto hedge funds continue to lag, with performance trailing Bitcoin in both 2025 and previous years. JPMorgan notes that “active crypto managers have not performed as well historically compared to passively managed crypto funds.”

The firm also connects crypto inflows to what it calls the “debasement trade,” driven by long-term concerns over inflation, fiscal deficits, and waning trust in fiat currencies. In this environment, Bitcoin is emerging alongside as a structural component in investor portfolios.",https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/jpmorgan-shifts-to-bullish-stance-on-crypto-amid-sector-tailwinds-4064834
2025-05-27,07:03,StanChart sees Solana price rising over 50% by end of 2025 By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- Standard Chartered has begun coverage on (SOL) with a year-end 2025 price target of $275, implying a gain of more than 50% from current levels around $175.

While the bank acknowledges that Solana is likely to underperform over the next two to three years, it sees longer-term potential for the network once new sectors start to scale.

“Solana is a fast, cheap alternative to Ethereum; as a result, it has dominated memecoin trading,” said Geoff Kendrick, Global Head of Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered, said, citing the network’s superior transaction throughput and reliability.

However, he notes that memecoin activity is “being discounted to a quantifiable degree by markets,” which has contributed to Solana trading “cheap” relative to its achieved application revenue, or “GDP.”

Most of Solana’s current usage is concentrated in trading applications, particularly decentralized exchanges that facilitate high-volume, low-value memecoin transactions. While this has helped stress-test the network’s capabilities, Kendrick warns that the associated revenues may be unsustainable.

“Solana trades ‘cheap’ on our market cap-to-GDP metric,” the analyst said, attributing this to a “more aggressive discount factor” being applied to future earnings compared to other chains.

“Put another way, Solana’s recent high fees and high activity on the back of memecoin trading may be seen as unsustainable,” Kendrick explained.

Looking ahead, Standard Chartered sees potential for Solana to dominate in emerging sectors like decentralized social media, high-throughput financial applications, and infrastructure platforms, though it expects these use cases to take two to three years to scale.

“The key to Solana’s future success will be to take its core advantage in transaction confirmation (fast, cheap and reliable) and apply it to something other than memecoin trading,” Kendrick continued.

Beyond the near-term challenges, the analyst forecasts SOL at $310 by end-2026 and $500 by end-2029. Standard Chartered’s year-end target for 2025 is $275.",https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/stanchart-sees-solana-price-rising-over-50-by-end-of-2025-4064655
2025-05-27,06:26,Citi sees up to 8% downside for Stoxx 600 on Trump tariff risk By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- Citi analysts warned in a note Tuesday that European equities could face significant downside if President Trump’s tariff threats materialize.

The bank outlined the potential implications of a 50% tariff on European goods, a scenario the firm is treating as hypothetical for now but one that has already rattled markets.

While Trump said on Sunday that he has agreed to delay the 50% tariff on the European Union until July 9, Citi noted that the “surprise announcement on a possible 50% tariff on European goods” had triggered broad selling in European equities.

The Index could drop “c7-8% from here” if the tariff threats are enacted and priced in, according to Citi’s projections.

Earnings estimates for European companies have already started to reflect increased geopolitical risks.

“Analyst consensus forecasts for 2025E European EPS growth have fallen from +7% pre-Liberation day to c2% now,” Citi noted. That decline is said to be consistent with their prior modeling of the earnings impact from a 20% tariff.

However, should tariffs rise to 50%, Citi’s top-down models suggest EPS growth could deteriorate further.

“EPS growth could fall another 5-6% to c-4%, if 50% broad tariffs are implemented,” they warned. “This comes against the backdrop of the market pricing in c4% EPS growth over the next 12m.”

Citi emphasized that the uncertainty surrounding trade policy is already dragging down sentiment and could translate into more pronounced equity declines if the threats are realized.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/citi-sees-up-to-8-downside-for-stoxx-600-on-trump-tariff-risk-4064531
2025-05-26,19:58,"Stock market today: S&P 500 rallies on consumer confidence, Trump EU tariff delay By Investing.com","Investing.com-- The S&P 500 rose sharply Tuesday after U.S. consumer confidence rebounded following a five-month slump, cooling fears about the economy just days after President President Donald Trump postponed plans to impose steep trade tariffs on the European Union.

At 4:00 p.m. ET (20:00 GMT), the rose 740 points, or 1.8%, the index gained 2.1%, and the advanced 2.5%.

Wall Street was closed on Monday on account of the Memorial Day holiday.

Consumer confidence jumps by the most in four years

Consumer confidence saw a strong rebound in May, ending a five-month decline, largely driven by renewed optimism surrounding economic conditions and boosted further by the U.S.-China trade deal announced mid-month.

According to The Conference Board, the Consumer Confidence Index surged 12.3 points to 98.0, surpassing expectations of just 87.1. The sharp rise was fueled by improvements in both consumers’ short-term outlook—reflected in the Expectations Index jumping 17.4 points to 72.8—and perceptions of current conditions, with the Present Situation Index up 4.8 points to 135.9.

Senior Economist Stephanie Guichard noted that confidence was already improving ahead of the trade deal but accelerated in its aftermath, highlighting the deal’s positive impact on consumer sentiment.

Tech rallies as Nvidia (NASDAQ: )’s earnings loom large; Tesla (NASDAQ: ), Coreweave jump

Big tech stocks led market higher, with Nvidia rising more than 3% ahead of its quarterly results due Wednesday after the market closes.

The company is considered a bellwether for global AI demand, especially in the chipmaking sector, and is sitting on a massive valuation spike over the past two years on this position.

Nvidia is expected to report bumper earnings, especially as Wall Street’s so-called AI Hyperscalers– its biggest customers– continued to spend heavily on AI over the past three months.

Elsewhere, Southwest Airlines (NYSE: ) stock rose after the carrier announced it will charge customers $35 for one checked bag and $45 for the second, bringing an end to its free luggage policy.

Salesforce (NYSE: ) stock gained after the Wall Street Journal reported that the software company is nearing an agreement to acquire Informatica in a deal valued at approximately $8 billion.

The quarterly earnings season is largely at an end, with more than 95% of companies having already reported, with almost 78% having surpassed analyst expectations, according to FactSet.

Numbers from IT service management company Okta (NASDAQ: ) are due after the bell Tuesday.

Elsewhere, Tesla climbed more than 6% after CEO Elon Musk said he would be ""super focused on /xAI and Tesla (plus Starship launch next week), as we have critical technologies rolling out.”

The remarks helped further restore confidence in Musk’s leadership amid concerns that his role within the Trump administration was taking too much of his focus.

CoreWeave Inc (NASDAQ: ) rose more than 20%, shrugging off a downgrade from Barclays to equalweight, citing concerns about limited short-term upside given the stock’s post-IPO run up.

Trump postpones 50% EU tariffs to July

Sentiment received a boost after Trump stated late Sunday that he had agreed to postpone his recently proposed 50% tariffs on goods from the EU to July 9, following a call with EU President Ursula von der Leyen.

Trump also said that his administration will begin trade talks in earnest with the EU, while Von Der Leyen also flagged improving relations with Washington.

The development offered some relief to markets, which were rattled on Friday by Trump threatening steep tariffs on the EU, along with Apple (NASDAQ: ).

This resulted in a losing week on Wall Street, with all three major indices falling more than 2% over the course of last week.

The July 9 deadline is also around when Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs are set to take effect, and the market’s remain focused on whether major U.S. trading partners can clinch agreements with Washington before the deadline.

More Fed speeches due

The U.S. president’s latest U-turn on EU tariffs reinforces how unpredictable his trade policies can be and undermines already fragile investor confidence in the U.S. economy.

An illustration of this uncertainty came with the orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods, which slumped in April, falling after the previous month’s sharp gains.

Orders for –items designed to last three years or more–fell 6.3% last month after a hefty revised 7.6% gain in March, the Commerce Department’s Census Bureau said on Tuesday.

Transportation equipment, down following four consecutive monthly increases, drove the decrease, falling $20.3 billion or 17.1 percent to $98.8 billion.

Minneapolis Federal Reserve President on Tuesday continued to call for a pause rates until there was more uncertainty on the tariff impact.

Investors are also likely Tuesday to carefully study commentary from Fed Governor Christopher Waller and New York Fed President and adding to a series of comments from their colleagues last week.

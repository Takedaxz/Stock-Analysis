2025-05-28,03:10,sell Nvidia ahead of earnings? Here’s what our AI model says By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- The moment the market has been holding its breath for is finally upon us. Today, after the market closes, AI powerhouse (NASDAQ: ) is set to report its fiscal Q126 earnings amid conflicting signals.

On the one hand, rising US export curbs due to high commercial tensions with China, as well as dwindling sales in the country, could weigh on the stock. On the other hand, however, a fairly low expectation in comparison to past quarters will likely leave the giant’s top and bottom lines within reach.

Against the volatile backdrop, we turned to our proprietary AI model for stock picking - available exclusively for InvestingPro members for less than $10 a month - for clues on whether it might be time to buy the stock ahead of its bombastic earnings report.

In fact, those who followed our AI’s picks since its launch in 2023 notched a game-changing 226.7% gain on Nvidia stock alone in the period that spanned from November 2023 to December 2024.

The stock was then dropped from our AI’s list in December and went on to move sideways for a full quarter, shedding -1.9% since.

During that period, our AI flagged other buys instead, which helped our users notch a massive 96.7% since launch, nearly doubling their money in less than two years and outpacing the broader by 57.96%.

Some of these other picks that rallied while Nvidia stalled are:

Microchip Technology (NASDAQ: ): 27.62%

Walt Disney Company (NYSE: ): 23.73%

MKS Instruments (NASDAQ: ): 22.79%

Axcelis Technologies (NASDAQ: ): 21.50%

Just to name a few...

Global investors also got their fair share of gains during the period, with names such as:

Thyssenkrupp (OTC: ) (Germany): 149.7%

Indra Sistemas (BME: ) SA (OTC: ): 112.18%

Iveco (BIT: ) (Italy): 96.47%

Now, with Nvidia earnings set for release tonight, our AI’s answer to whether this is the right time to buy the stock is not yet, for Nvidia is not part of our latest list of stock picks for May.

Does this mean that the stock will not do well in its earnings?

Well, not necesarily. What it really implies is that, according to a compilation of more than 150 investment-grade models, our AI found 15 other better bets for the month based on their fundamentals and chose them instead, signaling a better risk-return proposition for these stocks.

With the list for June on its way in just a few days, a good report on the fundamental side could also turn our AI model’s favor to the stock again.

Pro members get these picks first, with notifications on the first trading day of each month.

But how does our AI model actually work?

At the start of each month, our AI refreshes each strategy with up to 20 stock picks. These selections are based on a blend of more than 150 well-established financial models.

Some stocks are added, others stay on, and a few are dropped, reflecting how the AI evaluates their medium-term growth potential.

Performance is then tracked using equal weighting across all the stocks in the strategy. You don’t have to mirror that weighting exactly, but it gives a clear picture of how effective the model is at identifying opportunity across the board.

At the end of the day, stock picking is still a game of probabilities. But the key isn’t just finding winners—it’s knowing when to move on from the ones that no longer stack up.

Since launch, the model has done just that—delivering more than a few standout success stories along the way.

In fact, our backtests suggest that investors who follow the strategies over the long run will get even better results. See below:

2025-05-28,01:51,Bitcoin price today: steady at $109k amid legislative support at 2025 conference By Investing.com,"Investing.com-- held steady on Wednesday, remaining supported slightly below its recent record high, as investors closely monitored developments from the ongoing Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency was largely unchanged at $109,030.20 as of 01:41 ET (05:41 GMT).

The token surged to a record high of nearly $112,000 on Thursday last week, but gave some of the gains amid profit-booking and whale trades at peak levels.

Prices were supported near record highs amid regulatory cheer and optimism over increased institutional adoption.

Bitcoin 2025 Conference signals strategic support

The cryptocurrency hovered near its recent record high, buoyed by significant policy announcements and legislative endorsements at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, which started a day earlier.

At the conference, Bo Hines, the White House Digital Assets Advisor, emphasized the administration’s commitment to Bitcoin, referring to it as ""digital gold."" Hines stated that the U.S. government has no intention of selling its Bitcoin holdings and aims to accumulate more through strategic reserves.

Senator Cynthia Lummis also made headlines by announcing that President Donald Trump supports the BITCOIN Act, a bill proposing the acquisition of up to 1 million BTC over five years.

The legislation, set to be introduced to the Senate floor next week, seeks to formalize the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, initially funded by Bitcoin seized in federal cases.

These developments come in the wake of President Trump’s March 6 executive order, which established the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile.

The Bitcoin 2025 conference has attracted significant attention, with industry leaders and policymakers discussing the future of digital assets.

The event’s high-profile announcements have contributed to Bitcoin’s price stability, as investors anticipate increased institutional adoption and government support for the cryptocurrency.

This year’s edition is expected to be the largest to date, drawing over 30,000 attendees, featuring more than 400 speakers, and involving 5,000 participating companies.

2025-05-28,00:18,Nvidia Asian suppliers advance ahead of Q1 earnings By Investing.com,"Investing.com-- Shares of Nvidia’s Asian suppliers rose on Wednesday, as investors positioned for strong first-quarter earnings from the artificial intelligence major, which also acts as a bellwether for the tech industry.

Chipmakers and chip-adjacent stocks were the top gainers, with South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS: ) and SK Hynix Inc (KS: )- who supply Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) with memory chips- up 3.2% and 2.8%, respectively.

Japanese semiconductor testing equipment maker Advantest Corp. (TYO: ) added 1.4%, while Taiwan’s TSMC (TW: ) (NYSE: ) rose 0.5%. Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (TW: ) (Foxconn), which assembles Nvidia’s chipsets, moved in a flat-to-low range.

Gains in Nvidia’s suppliers tracked an over 3% jump in the firm’s shares on Tuesday, as it and broader tech stocks courted increased bids on improving risk appetite.

Nvidia is forecast to log earnings per share of $0.893 on revenue of $43.12 billion for the three months to April 31, both up substantially from last year, Investing.com data showed.

The company is expected to have benefited greatly from sustained demand as Wall Street’s so-called AI hyperscalers continued to pour billions into data centers and cloud infrastructure.

Focus will be squarely on Nvidia’s outlook, especially as the company grapples with stricter U.S. controls on sales to China. A shift towards AI inference from training, which is less data intensive, as well as increased interest in less demanding AI models, also stand to dampen future chip demand.

Nvidia’s shares have tended to underperform after the company’s earnings over the past three quarters, with its revenue or outlook usually missing some lofty expectations. This underperformance has also spilled over into shares of Nvidia’s suppliers in the past, with markets usually volatile in the run-up and aftermath of Nvidia’s earnings.

2025-05-27,22:52,Asia stocks rise tracking Wall St gains; Tech upbeat before Nvidia earnings By Investing.com,"Investing.com-- Most Asian stocks rose on Wednesday tracking a strong overnight session on Wall Street, as investors cheered President Donald Trump’s postponement of steep trade tariffs against Europe.

Technology stocks led gains for the day, buoyed by stellar earnings from China’s Xiaomi (OTC: ) (HK: ), and as investors piled into the sector before earnings from artificial intelligence major NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: ), which are due later today.

Gains in Asian markets came tracking a sharp overnight jump in Wall Street, as investors also cheered some signs of stability in the bond market. U.S. stock index futures were flat in regional trade, with steady around 5,934.0 points after the surged over 2%.

Some regional markets also lagged, with Australian shares rising marginally after a strong consumer inflation print.

Chinese shares moved in a flat-to-low range as weak earnings from ecommerce giant PDD Holdings (NASDAQ: ) added to concerns over sustained deflation and weak consumer spending in the country.

Tech stocks advance with Nvidia earnings in focus

Japan’s rose 0.6%, while South Korea’s rallied 1.8% to a nine-month high on outsized gains in technology stocks.

Japan’s Advantest Corp. (TYO: )- an Nvidia supplier- rose 2.2%, while South Korea’s SK Hynix Inc (KS: ) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS: ), who both supply Nvidia with memory chips– rose 2.7% and 3.3%, respectively.

Taiwan’s TSMC (TW: ) and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (TW: ) (Foxconn) rose about 0.5% each.

Investors were seen piling into tech, especially in chipmakers and AI-tangential stocks, as they positioned for a strong earnings print from Nvidia.

The AI major is set to report earnings after the U.S. close on Wednesday, and is forecast to clock strong earnings and revenue growth, as it continued to benefit from outsized spending on AI infrastructure, especially by major U.S. companies.

But focus will be on Nvidia’s outlook on AI demand and China, especially as the company grapples with stricter U.S. restrictions on chip exports to Beijing.

China shares lag, deflation concerns outweigh strong Xiaomi earnings

China’s and indexes fell marginally, while Hong Kong’s shed 0.3%.

Concerns over Chinese deflation and weak consumer spending came to fore this week following weak earnings from ecommerce major PDD. The company’s first-quarter profit nearly halved as local sales suffered from heightened competition and weak spending, while its international business, specifically budget marketplace Temu, was hit by heightened uncertainty over U.S. trade tariffs.

PDD’s weak print comes just a week after ecommerce major Alibaba’s earnings underwhelmed.

Concerns over deflation largely offset a strong showing from Xiaomi, which clocked a record first quarter profit. Xiaomi’s shares rose 1.6% in Hong Kong trade.

Broader Asian markets mostly advanced, although gains were limited in several markets. Australia’s rose 0.2%, lagging its regional peers as mildly stronger than expected raised some doubts over when the Reserve Bank of Australia will cut interest rates next.

2025-05-27,20:39,"Trump says Golden Dome to cost Canada $61 bln, but free if it gives up sovereignty By Investing.com","Investing.com-- U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that it would cost Canada $61 billion to be part of his proposed “Golden Dome” missile defense system, but that it would be free if the country became the 51st U.S. state.

“I told Canada, which very much wants to be part of our fabulous Golden Dome System, that it will cost $61 Billion Dollars if they remain a separate, but unequal, Nation, but will cost ZERO DOLLARS if they become our cherished 51st State,” Trump said in a post on Truth.social, claiming that Canada was “considering the offer.”

Trump’s comment comes after Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney last week expressed some interest in investing in the Golden Dome project, which is slated to cost about $175 billion.

Trump’s comments on Canada’s sovereignty are the latest in the president’s claims that Canada could become the 51st U.S. state- a claim that has been categorically rejected by Canada.

A spokesperson for Carney reiterated the country’s sovereignty, according to a comment carried by the Financial Times.

Canada and the U.S. already have a defense agreement– the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), which includes measures to detect ballistic missile attacks.

Trump’s proposed Golden Dome system plans to establish interceptors in space to protect the U.S. against advanced threats such as intercontinental ballistic missiles, hypersonic missiles, and long-range cruise missiles.

2025-05-27,20:35,"Elon Musk must face lawsuit over his role in DOGE under Trump, judge says By Investing.com","Investing.com-- A federal judge said on Tuesday that a lawsuit brought by 14 U.S. states challenging the legality of Elon Musk’s role in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under President Donald Trump may proceed.

The suit alleges that Tesla (NASDAQ: ) CEO Musk, classified as a “special Government employee,” functioned as a de facto principal officer of DOGE, an agency created by executive order without congressional authorization, and wielded sweeping authority over federal spending, personnel, and regulations.

The plaintiffs claimed Musk and DOGE unilaterally dismantled agencies, terminated federal contracts, and accessed sensitive systems in violation of the Constitution’s Appointments Clause, the judge stated in a court filing.

In a 42-page opinion, Judge Tanya S. Chutkan denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss the case against Musk and DOGE, allowing the states’ ultra vires claims to move forward. The court found the DOGE entity lacked a statutory or constitutional basis and that Musk’s alleged conduct exceeded lawful bounds.

However, the court dismissed claims against Trump in his official capacity, citing established precedent barring courts from enjoining the president’s discretionary duties.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/elon-musk-must-face-lawsuit-over-his-role-in-doge-under-trump-judge-says-4066381
2025-05-27,20:07,US stock futures steady with Nvidia earnings in focus By Investing.com,"Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures rose slightly on Tuesday evening with focus squarely on earnings from artificial intelligence major Nvidia, with sentiment upbeat on some trade tariff deescalation and positive consumer data.

Futures steadied after a stellar session on Wall Street, as investors cheered President Donald Trump’s delaying of steep trade tariffs against the European Union, while stronger-than-expected consumer confidence data pointed to resilience in the economy.

Technology stocks also courted heavy buying before Nvidia’s earnings, which are likely to act as a bellwether for the sector. Analysts expect another strong quarter from the chipmaker.

Nvidia Q1 earnings awaited for more AI cues; shares surge

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: ) is set to report its first-quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday, with analysts expecting a strong print.

Shares of the AI major surged 3.2% on Tuesday and were flat in after-hours trade.

Nvidia is forecast to post earnings per share of $0.893 on revenue of $43.12 billion for the three months to April 30, both up substantially from last year, Investing.com data showed.

The chipmaker is expected to have benefited from outsized domestic demand, especially as its biggest customers– Wall Street’s so-called AI hyperscalers– continued spending billions on building more data center capacity.

But focus will be on Nvidia’s outlook, which is likely to set the tone for the tech industry going forward in 2025. Investors will also be watching for comments on Nvidia’s China sales, as the company grapples with more U.S. export controls and increased competition in the country.

CEO Jensen Huang recently criticized the U.S. export restrictions, calling them a ""failure,"" and also forecast China becoming a $50 billion market in the coming years.

Wall St rises on Trump tariff delay, strong consumer sentiment

Wall Street clocked strong gains on Tuesday, after Trump’s delaying of 50% tariffs against the EU boosted risk appetite. Trump’s move– which is another instance of the president flip-flopping on his tariff plans– spurred bets that he will not deliver on his agenda of imposing steep reciprocal trade tariffs in July.

Sentiment was also boosted by substantially stronger than expected data for May, which rebounded after five months of declines.

The rebound also comes following a deescalation in trade tensions between the U.S. and China, and as Trump’s administration attempts to reach trade deals with several major economies.

2025-05-27,16:41,Nvidia suppliers ramp up AI server production after technical snag,"Investing.com -- NVIDIA (NASDAQ: ) suppliers, including industry leaders like Foxconn (SS: ), Inventec, Dell (NYSE: ), and Wistron, have overcome technical challenges that previously delayed shipments of Nvidia’s flagship AI data center racks, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday. This development marks a significant stride in the company’s efforts to enhance its global sales initiatives.

The technical issues, which arose toward the end of last year, had impeded the production of the highly anticipated ""Blackwell"" AI servers. These servers are expected to substantially boost computing power for training and utilizing large language models, a promise made by Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, upon the product’s announcement last year.

The resolution of these technical difficulties is a welcome relief for Nvidia, as it aims to meet its ambitious annual sales targets. The suppliers’ breakthroughs have enabled the commencement of shipments, which is likely to contribute positively to the company’s performance.

Nvidia’s Blackwell AI servers are part of a broader strategy to solidify the chipmaker’s position in the rapidly growing field of artificial intelligence. The successful deployment of these servers is crucial for the company to maintain its competitive edge and fulfill the expectations set by its leadership.

This latest advancement underscores Nvidia’s resilience in addressing production challenges and reaffirms its commitment to delivering cutting-edge technology solutions to its customers. As shipments begin, the market is watching closely to see how this will translate into financial performance for the semiconductor giant in the coming quarters.

2025-05-27,08:32,25% tariff not enough to push Apple to reshore iPhone production,"Investing.com -- A 25% tariff on iPhones imported into the United States is unlikely to drive Apple (NASDAQ: ) to reshore its production, according to Morgan Stanley analysts.

“While ‘time to market’ of a U.S.-produced iPhone is one major impediment, our math says a 25% tariff on iPhone imports isn’t enough incentive for Apple to reshore U.S.-bound iPhone production,” the analysts wrote.

They estimate it would take “a minimum of 2+ years, and several billions” to build new iPhone assembly plants in the U.S.

President Trump reignited tariff concerns last week, threatening a 25% import tax on iPhones.

The move appeared to be a response to Apple’s continued shift of U.S.-bound iPhone assembly to India, away from China.

However, Morgan Stanley said the economics still favor overseas manufacturing. “A U.S.-produced iPhone would be 35% more expensive than a China/India-produced iPhone, much more than the 4-6% price hike needed to offset a 25% import tariff,” the note said.

The bank believes Apple’s defiance could come at a cost. “CEO Tim Cook’s status with the current administration deteriorates from here,” Morgan Stanley warned, adding that Apple now risks further tariff escalation. “Is a 50% tariff enough to shift production to the U.S.?” the bank asked.

The firm noted that it has already factored in 10-30% tariffs on all U.S.-bound imports beyond the June quarter and estimates the proposed 25% smartphone tariff would only reduce Apple’s FY26 EPS by about 11 cents.

Despite the pressure, Morgan Stanley believes Apple could neutralize the threat with further U.S. investment, as part of its previously announced $500 billion commitment.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/25-tariff-not-enough-to-push-apple-to-reshore-iphone-production--morgan-stanley-4064984
2025-05-27,08:23,JPM highlights top 6 European investment ideas for next 12–18 months By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- JPMorgan has laid out its top six investment ideas in Europe over the next 12 to 18 months, highlighting a range of sectors it expects to benefit from structural and policy-driven shifts.

First, the Wall Street giant’s strategists, led by Mislav Matejk,a maintain a bullish stance on European defense, citing “increased Defense spending, where European countries are set to shift from an average 2% Defense spending as a share of GDP towards 3.5% later this decade.”

While the group’s valuations appear stretched after strong recent gains, the strategists believe “earnings will deliver” and continue to view the sector as a structural buy.

The second opportunity is linked to Germany’s €500 billion infrastructure fund, which JPMorgan expects to support names across construction materials, industrials, and transportation.

The fund, set to be spent over 12 years, is seen as a key fiscal stimulus driver. Stocks in JPMorgan’s “Germany Whatever It Takes” basket are viewed as well-positioned to benefit from the rollout.

The basket includes stocks such as Siemens (ETR: ), UniCredit SpA (BIT: ), Rheinmetall (ETR: ), Vinci (EPA: ), Siemens Energy AG (ETR: ), and dozens of other stocks.

JPMorgan’s third idea centers on financials. While tactically cautious on banks due to falling rates, the bank sees medium-term upside driven by improving balance sheets, credit flow recovery, and declining cost of equity.

Insurance is also favored, with analysts staying Overweight on this subsector in the medium term, despite short-term valuation concerns.

The fourth theme focuses on beneficiaries of lower energy prices, especially in the chemicals sector. JPMorgan highlights that “chemicals are the only one of the EM-exposed Cyclicals which are starting to perform less poorly,” and reiterates its overweight stance made earlier this year.

Utilities and Telecoms make up the fifth category. JPMorgan sees opportunities in stocks offering high dividend yields, benefiting from higher grid spending and cash flow improvements.

“Our analysts are positive on RWE (LON: ), National Grid (LON: ), and Engie SA (EPA: ),” the note says, while Deutsche Telekom (ETR: ) and Orange SA (EPA: ) are highlighted within telecoms.

Finally, JPMorgan sees value in German small caps. The index has lagged large caps for several years, but the bank believes the underperformance could reverse as fiscal stimulus and industrial exposure provide support.

“MDAX appears attractively priced relative to and is underowned,” the strategists wrote.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/jpm-highlights-top-6-european-investment-ideas-for-next-1218-months-4064930
2025-05-27,08:05,"Next 300 points likely up for the S&P 500, says JPMorgan By Investing.com","Investing.com -- JPMorgan analysts see the next move for the as higher, despite the pullback in U.S. equities last week.

“The SPX fell 2.6% last week, trimming the MTD gain to 4.2% and pushing the YTD return back into negative territory, -1.3%,” JPMorgan said.

Despite this setback, the bank’s analysts argue the recent weakness represents a brief correction rather than a shift in direction.

“We had flagged pullback risk and believe that we experienced that last week,” JPMorgan said.

While the S&P 500 is still less than 6% below its all-time high, JPMorgan believes the “next 300 points” are more likely to be to the upside.

Their tactical bullish stance is based on three main drivers: “(i) stable macro data; (ii) positive earnings; and (iii) a further de-escalation of the trade war.”

Market volatility was elevated last week amid concerns about the U.S. fiscal outlook.

“While the 10Y yield only rose 3.4bps on the week, it traded in a 20bp range as the MOVE index increased 4.4%,“ JPMorgan wrote.

Meanwhile, international developed and emerging markets outperformed the U.S. last week, as the dollar continued to weaken, with the DXY falling another 2%.

2025-05-27,07:54,JPMorgan shifts to bullish stance on crypto amid sector tailwinds By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- JPMorgan has turned bullish on digital assets, citing a range of positive catalysts that could support the sector through the rest of 2025.

“We turn more constructive on digital assets,” strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said in a Monday note, highlighting a change in stance after a period of lackluster performance from both CTAs and crypto hedge funds earlier this year.

One of the key drivers for the renewed optimism is the anticipated wave of institutional adoption. JPMorgan points to “additional buying from MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: ) and other Bitcoin-accumulating corporates.”

The Wall Street bank also points out positive policy developments, such as “more U.S. states allowing to be added to their strategic reserves” and the expected regulatory progress in crypto derivatives and stablecoins.

These changes, according to the bank, could induce “more confidence and greater participation by traditional institutional investors.”

While the sector has seen volatile returns—with digital assets down 17.9% in Q1 after a strong performance in 2024—the bank sees regulatory clarity and broadening use cases as critical tailwinds.

JPMorgan also forecasts a 10% projected return for digital assets, the highest among all alternative investment classes in its updated allocation model.

The more bullish view comes as JPMorgan moves alternatives to an Underweight position overall, cutting exposure to private equity, private credit, and real estate.

In contrast, the bank has upgraded digital assets to an Overweight alongside hedge funds and traditional public equities.

Despite the renewed interest, crypto hedge funds continue to lag, with performance trailing Bitcoin in both 2025 and previous years. JPMorgan notes that “active crypto managers have not performed as well historically compared to passively managed crypto funds.”

The firm also connects crypto inflows to what it calls the “debasement trade,” driven by long-term concerns over inflation, fiscal deficits, and waning trust in fiat currencies.

2025-05-27,07:30,New surveys show declining interest in EVs and the Tesla brand around the world By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- Consumer interest in electric vehicles (EVs) and the Tesla (NASDAQ: ) brand is waning across key global markets, according to new survey data.

The latest UBS Evidence Lab Global EV Survey, which included over 10,000 respondents, shows a broad decline in Tesla’s standing as a preferred EV brand in the U.S., China, and Europe.

Globally, the share of consumers who would consider buying a Tesla has fallen to 36%, down from 39% last year. As a top battery electric vehicle (BEV) choice, Tesla slipped to 18% from 22%.

“The top choice decline was fairly prominent across the 3 major regions for Tesla,” UBS analysts led by Joseph Spak.

In the U.S., Tesla’s top choice share dropped sharply to 29% from 38%, despite maintaining a 48% share of the domestic BEV market. UBS attributes the slide to brand “saturation, a limited vehicle lineup, and affordability concerns.”

In China, Tesla fell to third place behind BYD (SZ: ) and Xiaomi Corp (HK: ), with top-choice preference down to 14% from 18%. Chinese consumers increasingly favor domestic brands, and Tesla is no longer viewed as the technology leader.

Moreover, Tesla’s top-choice ranking in Europe declined to 15% from 20%, with Audi and BMW (ETR: ) surpassing it in brand consideration.

Meanwhile, brokerage firm Stifel’s own survey shows that Tesla’s appeal is becoming more politically polarized in the U.S.

Net purchase consideration among Democrats dropped to -46% in May, from -30% in August 2024. Meanwhile, it improved among Republicans to -14% from -26%.

“The inflection point since August 2024 is likely due to numerous factors, but mainly Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s endorsement of President Trump and involvement in his Administration,” Stifel said.

“However, recent discussions of Elon Musk’s gradual scale back away from DOGE and political affiliations could lead to another inflection point in the data over the next few months,” it added.

Despite weaker sales volumes tied to shifting sentiment, Stifel’s team believes that progress on Full Self-Driving (FSD) and recent comments from Elon Musk about its rollout could be a more significant driver of Tesla shares in the coming quarters.

UBS’ data also raises questions about Tesla’s autonomous driving strategy. The bank found that only 12% of consumers globally are willing to pay more than $7,600 upfront for autonomous features, while just 18% would pay more than $100 per month. Tesla’s FSD product currently costs $8,000 upfront or $99 monthly.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/new-surveys-show-declining-interest-in-evs-and-the-tesla-brand-around-the-world-4064783
2025-05-27,07:03,StanChart sees Solana price rising over 50% by end of 2025 By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- Standard Chartered has begun coverage on (SOL) with a year-end 2025 price target of $275, implying a gain of more than 50% from current levels around $175.

While the bank acknowledges that Solana is likely to underperform over the next two to three years, it sees longer-term potential for the network once new sectors start to scale.

“Solana is a fast, cheap alternative to Ethereum; as a result, it has dominated memecoin trading,” said Geoff Kendrick, Global Head of Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered, said, citing the network’s superior transaction throughput and reliability.

However, he notes that memecoin activity is “being discounted to a quantifiable degree by markets,” which has contributed to Solana trading “cheap” relative to its achieved application revenue, or “GDP.”

Most of Solana’s current usage is concentrated in trading applications, particularly decentralized exchanges that facilitate high-volume, low-value memecoin transactions. While this has helped stress-test the network’s capabilities, Kendrick warns that the associated revenues may be unsustainable.

“Solana trades ‘cheap’ on our market cap-to-GDP metric,” the analyst said, attributing this to a “more aggressive discount factor” being applied to future earnings compared to other chains.

“Put another way, Solana’s recent high fees and high activity on the back of memecoin trading may be seen as unsustainable,” Kendrick explained.

Looking ahead, Standard Chartered sees potential for Solana to dominate in emerging sectors like decentralized social media, high-throughput financial applications, and infrastructure platforms, though it expects these use cases to take two to three years to scale.

“The key to Solana’s future success will be to take its core advantage in transaction confirmation (fast, cheap and reliable) and apply it to something other than memecoin trading,” Kendrick continued.

Beyond the near-term challenges, the analyst forecasts SOL at $310 by end-2026 and $500 by end-2029. Standard Chartered’s year-end target for 2025 is $275.",https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/stanchart-sees-solana-price-rising-over-50-by-end-of-2025-4064655
2025-05-27,06:26,Citi sees up to 8% downside for Stoxx 600 on Trump tariff risk By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- Citi analysts warned in a note Tuesday that European equities could face significant downside if President Trump’s tariff threats materialize.

The bank outlined the potential implications of a 50% tariff on European goods, a scenario the firm is treating as hypothetical for now but one that has already rattled markets.

While Trump said on Sunday that he has agreed to delay the 50% tariff on the European Union until July 9, Citi noted that the “surprise announcement on a possible 50% tariff on European goods” had triggered broad selling in European equities.

The Index could drop “c7-8% from here” if the tariff threats are enacted and priced in, according to Citi’s projections.

Earnings estimates for European companies have already started to reflect increased geopolitical risks.

“Analyst consensus forecasts for 2025E European EPS growth have fallen from +7% pre-Liberation day to c2% now,” Citi noted. That decline is said to be consistent with their prior modeling of the earnings impact from a 20% tariff.

However, should tariffs rise to 50%, Citi’s top-down models suggest EPS growth could deteriorate further.

“EPS growth could fall another 5-6% to c-4%, if 50% broad tariffs are implemented,” they warned. “This comes against the backdrop of the market pricing in c4% EPS growth over the next 12m.”

Citi emphasized that the uncertainty surrounding trade policy is already dragging down sentiment and could translate into more pronounced equity declines if the threats are realized.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/citi-sees-up-to-8-downside-for-stoxx-600-on-trump-tariff-risk-4064531
2025-05-27,04:55,What could be the impact of a 50% tariff on EU economy? By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat to impose a 50% tariff on imports from the European Union could significantly undermine eurozone growth and raise the risk of a broader trade conflict, according to UBS.

While the initial move was delayed until July 9 following talks with European Commission (EC) President Ursula von der Leyen, UBS warns that this is not a “stable equilibrium” and that the risk of escalation remains elevated.

UBS had previously estimated that the 20% reciprocal tariffs announced in April would push the eurozone into a technical recession in the second half of 2025, reducing growth by 0.7 percentage points.

In the case of a 50% tariff, the impact could be even deeper. “A 50% tariff—if maintained—would roughly imply a doubling of the effective tariff rate announced on April 2,” UBS economists led by Felix Huefner wrote.

They estimate eurozone GDP growth could fall from the current forecast of 0.7% in 2025 and 1% in 2026 to just 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively.

In the near term, companies may front-load shipments to the U.S. ahead of the July deadline, potentially boosting second-quarter activity. However, the economists note this would likely be followed by weaker performance later in the year.

The tariff shock so far has been disinflationary, but that could reverse if the EU retaliates. “Should the EC implement retaliation measures, inflation pressures could increase, everything else being equal.”

Brussels has already prepared two retaliation packages: a €21 billion list of tariffs delayed until July 14, and a broader €95 billion proposal under public consultation. Should negotiations with the U.S. collapse, UBS expects the EU to respond, viewing the current blanket and sectoral tariffs as “probably unacceptable” to the Commission.

“Overall then, this could potentially lead to a further escalation in trade tensions with the U.S.,” the economists added.

While fiscal spending on infrastructure and defense may support growth starting in 2026, UBS sees the coming months as pivotal.

The bank warns that recent developments increase the risk that U.S. tariffs may remain elevated after mid-July, undermining hopes for a rollback and threatening growth, while also heightening the chance of EU retaliation that could trigger a tit-for-tat escalation with negative impacts on both growth and inflation.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/what-could-be-the-impact-of-a-50tariff-on-eu-economy-4064349
2025-05-27,03:20,"Higher U.S. futures, new Nvidia chip, falling Tesla sales","Investing.com - U.S. stock futures gained strongly Tuesday as U.S. President Donald Trump postponed the imposition of tariffs on EU imports, potentially leaving room for negotiations to avoid a costly trade war. Elsewhere, Nvidia is working on a new chip for the Chinese market, Tesla’s sales slumped in Europe in April and bitcoin slipped from record highs ahead of a key conference.

1. U.S. futures surge on EU tariffs postponement

U.S. stock futures surged Tuesday, responding to the news that President Trump has agreed to postpone imposing tariffs on imports from the European Union, raising hope that a potentially costly trade battle can be averted.

At 03:10 ET (07:10 GMT), the traded 70 points, or 1.2%, higher gained 290 points, or 1.4%, and rose 435 points, or 1.1%.

Wall Street was closed on Monday in recognition of Memorial Day, and the major indices all slid more than 2% on Friday after Trump proposed a 50% tariff on EU imports starting June 1, citing ongoing frustrations with trade negotiations.

However, by Sunday, Trump indicated a shift in stance, stating that he had agreed to postpone the tariffs until July 9 after a conversation with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

Von der Leyen, in a post on X, expressed optimism, stating that the EU is prepared to move forward with negotiations “swiftly and decisively.”

The U.S. president’s latest U-turn on EU tariffs reinforces how unpredictable his trade policies can be and undermines already fragile investor confidence in the U.S. economy.

With this in mind, investors are likely Tuesday to carefully study commentary from Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari and New York Fed President John Williams, adding to a series of comments from their colleagues last week.

“A number of Fed speakers took to the airwaves. The message is tariffs are likely to create risks on both sides of the Fed’s mandate. The right response is to wait,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote, summing up the consensus ahead of the June FOMC meeting.

2. Nvidia plans to launch new AI chip in China - Reuters

Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) plans to launch, potentially as early as June, a new artificial intelligence chip in China at a lower price than its recently restricted H20 chip, according to a report from Reuters.

The proposed chip will have weaker specifications and simpler manufacturing requirements, and will use conventional GDDR7 memory instead of the high bandwidth memory used by more advanced AI chips.

The push for a new China chip comes as Nvidia struggles against new U.S. export restrictions to remain competitive in the Chinese market.

Nvidia has been steadily losing market share in China since 2022, dropping to 50% from 95%, but CEO Jensen Huang recently said China remained a valuable market for Nvidia, and could balloon to a $50 billion sales market in the coming years.

Nvidia faces stiff competition from China’s Huawei, which has made steady advancements in its AI chip development capabilities in recent years.

3. Tesla sales continue to plunge in Europe

Electric vehicle market leader Tesla’s (NASDAQ: ) sales in Europe continued to slump last month, dropping by nearly a half from last year, government data showed earlier Tuesday.

Tesla’s new car registrations in the European Union, the European Free Trade Association, and the U.K., slid 49% year-on-year to 7,261 units in April from 14,228 units a year ago, data from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association showed.

Tesla’s market share also nearly halved to 0.7% from 1.3% a year ago.

The drop came even as overall battery EV sales continued to expand in Europe, growing 34.1% year-on-year to 145,341 new registrations in April.

Overall European new car registrations shrank marginally to 1.07 million units from 1.08 million units.

Tesla is struggling with increased competition for an aging lineup from several established European automakers, who have also begun offering their own EVs. Chinese EV exports to Europe have also picked up in recent months, despite increased import tariffs on the sector.

A persistent decline in European sales also indicated that a Tesla boycott, centered around CEO Elon Musk and his political affiliations, showed little signs of easing in the region.

4. Bitcoin slips from highs ahead of key conference

slipped Tuesday from last week’s record high, as investors turned their focus to the start of the major 2025 Bitcoin conference in Las Vegas later in the session.

At 03:10 ET, the world’s largest cryptocurrency fell 0.9% to $109,050.

The token surged to a record high of nearly $112,000 on Thursday last week, amid regulatory cheer and optimism over increased institutional adoption.

Markets now await the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, beginning later Tuesday at the Venetian Expo in Las Vegas.

This year’s edition is expected to be the largest to date, drawing over 30,000 attendees, featuring more than 400 speakers, and involving 5,000 participating companies.

5. Crude stable ahead of OPEC+ meeting

Oil prices steadied Tuesday, as investors stayed on the sidelines ahead of a closely watched OPEC+ meeting that could provide key signals on future supply levels.

At 03:10 ET, futures dropped 0.1% to $64.08 a barrel, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 0.1% to $61.47 a barrel.

The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, collectively known as OPEC+, are weighing the possibility of another production boost at their upcoming meeting later this week, Bloomberg News reported last week.

According to reports, one option under consideration is a supply increase of 411,000 barrels per day in July, though no final decision has been made.

OPEC+ has been in the process of unwinding output cuts, announcing additions to the market in May and June.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency added 0.1% to $109,710.0 as of 09:53 ET (13:53 GMT).

The token surged to a record high of nearly $112,000 on Thursday last week, but gave some of the gains amid profit-booking and whale trades at peak levels.

Still, prices were supported near record highs amid regulatory cheer and optimism over increased institutional adoption.

Bitcoin near record high; markets await 2025 crypto conference

Bitcoin surged to a record high last week as both the U.S. and Hong Kong advanced significant regulatory initiatives aimed at establishing comprehensive frameworks for stablecoins.

In the U.S., the Senate advanced the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act. Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s legislature passed a landmark stablecoin bill, introducing a licensing framework for fiat-referenced stablecoin issuers.

Investors also saw a shift in Wall Street’s view, where reports emerged that major U.S. banks were considering launching a joint stablecoin venture.

Markets now await the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, beginning on May 27 at the Venetian Expo in Las Vegas.

This year’s edition is expected to be the largest to date, drawing over 30,000 attendees, featuring more than 400 speakers, and involving 5,000 participating companies.

Notable speakers at the event include Michael Saylor, Justin Sun, Jack Mallers, and Robinhood (NASDAQ: ) CEO Vlad Tenev.

U.S. Vice President JD Vance, Senator Cynthia Lummis, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, and economist Peter Schiff are also scheduled to appear.

Trump Media to raise $2.5bn for Bitcoin treasury, shares sink

Trump Media & Technology Group said Tuesday that it has reached agreements with institutional investors to raise approximately $2.5 billion, with plans to use the funds to establish a Bitcoin treasury.

Shares of the Truth Social operator fell around 7% following the market open on Tuesday.

The news comes after Trump Media denied a Financial Times report that it plans to raise $3 billion to invest in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, calling the story writers ""dumb"" and the sources unreliable.

TMTG, the media company backed by the Trump family and parent of Truth Social, is seeking $2 billion in equity and $1 billion through a convertible bond to finance large-scale crypto purchases, the FT reported on Monday, citing six people familiar with the matter.

The FT report sent Trump Media shares soaring roughly 11% in premarket trading Tuesday, before reversing all of the gains.

The yellow metal was also pressured by some signs of stability in the bond market, as major government bond yields retreated in Asian trade after a sharp run-up in recent sessions.

Still, gold’s overall losses were limited by persistent weakness in the dollar. But broader metal prices also lost ground after strong gains through the past week.

Gold dips as Trump tariff turnaround spurs risk

Gold was pressured chiefly by some improving risk appetite after Trump delayed plans to immediately impose 50% tariffs on the European Union.

Trump said the tariffs will kick-in by early-July, when the rest of his planned reciprocal tariffs are also set to take effect.

The move offered some relief to markets fearing a worsening in global trade conditions, and sparked buying into risk-driven assets. U.S. stock index futures rose sharply on Tuesday, although volumes were dulled by a U.S. holiday on Monday.

But despite this week’s losses, gold still remained relatively underpinned by concerns over the long-term impact of Trump’s tariffs.

Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari warned on Monday that the tariffs were likely to spur a stagflationary shock for the U.S. economy, ie– an era of sluggish growth and high inflation.

But he also said that the Fed was unlikely to cut rates in the near-term, helping spur some buying in battered U.S. Treasuries.

Metal prices sink as Treasuries, bond yields stabilize

Broader metal prices fell on Tuesday, amid some buying into government bonds after a sharp selldown in the sector over the past week.

A Moody’s downgrade to the U.S. sovereign rating, coupled with the progress of a divisive tax cut bill in Congress, sparked heightened concerns over high government debt levels.

These concerns sparked an extended selldown in Treasuries, sending yields up sharply. But yields were seen coming down from recent peaks on Tuesday, while the dollar steadied, pressuring metal prices.

Wall Street was closed on Monday on account of the Memorial Day holiday.

Consumer confidence jumps by the most in four years

Consumer confidence saw a strong rebound in May, ending a five-month decline, largely driven by renewed optimism surrounding economic conditions and boosted further by the U.S.-China trade deal announced mid-month.

According to The Conference Board, the Consumer Confidence Index surged 12.3 points to 98.0, surpassing expectations of just 87.1. The sharp rise was fueled by improvements in both consumers’ short-term outlook—reflected in the Expectations Index jumping 17.4 points to 72.8—and perceptions of current conditions, with the Present Situation Index up 4.8 points to 135.9.

Senior Economist Stephanie Guichard noted that confidence was already improving ahead of the trade deal but accelerated in its aftermath, highlighting the deal’s positive impact on consumer sentiment.

Tech rallies as Nvidia (NASDAQ: )’s earnings loom large; Tesla (NASDAQ: ), Coreweave jump

Big tech stocks led market higher, with Nvidia rising more than 3% ahead of its quarterly results due Wednesday after the market closes.

The company is considered a bellwether for global AI demand, especially in the chipmaking sector, and is sitting on a massive valuation spike over the past two years on this position.

Nvidia is expected to report bumper earnings, especially as Wall Street’s so-called AI Hyperscalers– its biggest customers– continued to spend heavily on AI over the past three months.

Elsewhere, Southwest Airlines (NYSE: ) stock rose after the carrier announced it will charge customers $35 for one checked bag and $45 for the second, bringing an end to its free luggage policy.

Salesforce (NYSE: ) stock gained after the Wall Street Journal reported that the software company is nearing an agreement to acquire Informatica in a deal valued at approximately $8 billion.

The quarterly earnings season is largely at an end, with more than 95% of companies having already reported, with almost 78% having surpassed analyst expectations, according to FactSet.

Numbers from IT service management company Okta (NASDAQ: ) are due after the bell Tuesday.

Elsewhere, Tesla climbed more than 6% after CEO Elon Musk said he would be ""super focused on /xAI and Tesla (plus Starship launch next week), as we have critical technologies rolling out.”

The remarks helped further restore confidence in Musk’s leadership amid concerns that his role within the Trump administration was taking too much of his focus.

CoreWeave Inc (NASDAQ: ) rose more than 20%, shrugging off a downgrade from Barclays to equalweight, citing concerns about limited short-term upside given the stock’s post-IPO run up.

Trump postpones 50% EU tariffs to July

Sentiment received a boost after Trump stated late Sunday that he had agreed to postpone his recently proposed 50% tariffs on goods from the EU to July 9, following a call with EU President Ursula von der Leyen.

Trump also said that his administration will begin trade talks in earnest with the EU, while Von Der Leyen also flagged improving relations with Washington.

The development offered some relief to markets, which were rattled on Friday by Trump threatening steep tariffs on the EU, along with Apple (NASDAQ: ).

This resulted in a losing week on Wall Street, with all three major indices falling more than 2% over the course of last week.

The July 9 deadline is also around when Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs are set to take effect, and the market’s remain focused on whether major U.S. trading partners can clinch agreements with Washington before the deadline.

More Fed speeches due

The U.S. president’s latest U-turn on EU tariffs reinforces how unpredictable his trade policies can be and undermines already fragile investor confidence in the U.S. economy.

An illustration of this uncertainty came with the orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods, which slumped in April, falling after the previous month’s sharp gains.

Orders for –items designed to last three years or more–fell 6.3% last month after a hefty revised 7.6% gain in March, the Commerce Department’s Census Bureau said on Tuesday.

Transportation equipment, down following four consecutive monthly increases, drove the decrease, falling $20.3 billion or 17.1 percent to $98.8 billion.

Minneapolis Federal Reserve President on Tuesday continued to call for a pause rates until there was more uncertainty on the tariff impact.

Investors are also likely Tuesday to carefully study commentary from Fed Governor Christopher Waller and New York Fed President and adding to a series of comments from their colleagues last week.

2025-05-27,12:38,Qualcomm-backed study finds Apple’s in-house modem falls short in 5G tests By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: ) is touting a new study highlighting the performance edge of its 5G modem chips over Apple Inc’s (NASDAQ: ) first in-house modem, as both tech giants vie for wireless supremacy. The report, conducted by Cellular Insights and funded by Qualcomm, found that Android smartphones powered by its Snapdragon X75 and X80 modems significantly outperformed Apple’s C1 modem in download and upload speeds, particularly in challenging urban 5G environments.

Apple’s iPhone 16e, the first device equipped with its custom-built modem, lagged behind competitors while connected to T-Mobile’s standalone 5G network in New York City. According to the study, Qualcomm-powered Android phones recorded up to 35% faster download speeds and as much as 91% faster upload performance.

While Apple’s modem kept pace under ideal signal conditions close to cell towers, performance gaps widened in low-signal areas such as indoors or at greater distances. “Performance deltas became increasingly pronounced as signal conditions deteriorated,” the Cellular Insights report stated, citing more consistent throughput and superior carrier aggregation on Qualcomm hardware.

The test results come at a strategic inflection point for both companies. Apple spent years developing the C1 modem to reduce reliance on outside suppliers, with Qualcomm previously serving as Apple’s exclusive provider and generating nearly 20% of its revenue from the relationship at its peak.

Qualcomm’s modems leveraged advanced features such as 4CC downlink and 2CC uplink carrier aggregation, while the iPhone 16e lacked observed ULCA and had fewer active component carriers. “Greater platform maturity” and support for features like FDD+FDD ULCA were described as key differentiators in the report.

Despite being commissioned by Qualcomm, the study offers early insights into the technical hurdles Apple faces in bringing critical infrastructure components in-house. The C1 modem marks a first attempt in a segment where Qualcomm has a two-decade development lead and wide licensing moat.

Wall Street has taken note: Qualcomm shares rose 2.6% amid the report’s publication, reflecting investor confidence in its continuing technological advantage. Apple stock was left unchanged, up 2.5%, but the company could face scrutiny over whether future iterations of its modem can close the performance gap.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/qualcommbacked-study-finds-apples-inhouse-modem-falls-short-in-5g-tests-4065762
2025-05-27,10:33,US Consumer bounces back sharply in May By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- Consumer confidence rebounded in May, ending a five-month streak of declines, according to new data from The Conference Board.

The Consumer Confidence Index jumped 12.3 points to 98.0, rising from April’s 85.7 reading, and coming in above the consensus forecast of 87.1.

Meanwhile, the Expectations Index, which measures consumers’ short-term outlook, climbed 17.4 points to 72.8, while the Present Situation Index rose 4.8 points to 135.9.

“Consumer confidence improved in May after five consecutive months of decline,” said Stephanie Guichard, Senior Economist at The Conference Board. “The rebound was already visible before the May 12 U.S.-China trade deal but gained momentum afterwards.”

Expectations for business conditions, jobs, and income all improved, with the share of consumers expecting their income to rise increasing to 18%, up from 15.9% in April. The share expecting more jobs rose to 19.2%, from 13.9%.

The Conference Board said purchasing plans also rebounded, with more consumers intending to buy homes, cars, appliances, and services.

Optimism about stock prices increased, with 44% expecting gains in the next year, up from 37.6% in April.

While inflation and affordability remained concerns, average 12-month inflation expectations eased to 6.5%. 19% reported advancing purchases ahead of tariffs, though that number was higher among wealthier households.

“May’s rebound in confidence was broad-based across all age groups and all income groups,” said the Conference Board. “It was also shared across all political affiliations, with the strongest improvements among Republicans.”

However, it was noted that on a six-month moving average basis, confidence remains down.

Despite lingering anxieties over affordability, Guichard said that “the monthly improvement was largely driven by consumer expectations” and the overall rebound was broad-based.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/us-consumer-bounces-back-sharply-in-may-4065501
2025-05-27,09:41,"Lynx: Risk priced in, Nvidia could surprise to the upside By Investing.com","Investing.com -- Nvidia stock could break out to new highs following its earnings report, according to Lynx Equity, which has raised its price target from $140 to $160.

“After a couple of quarters of inline results, we think NVDA has the potential to provide upside to muted investor expectations,” the firm wrote in a new note.

Lynx, which had previously highlighted concerns such as heating issues with the GB300 GPU and tariff exposure, now sees many risks as “priced in.”

The analysts credited Nvidia’s ability to “steamroll through” challenges ranging from delayed product launches and trade restrictions to grid limitations and scaling constraints.

They cited new growth vectors and capacity expansion as reasons for optimism.

“GB200 has overcome its teething issues,” Lynx said, pointing to a sharp ramp-up in production at Foxconn (SS: ) and a $500 million new manufacturing campus in Texas. Additionally, a resurgence in CoWoS capacity build at TSMC signals recovery in Nvidia’s supply chain.

Lynx also highlighted Nvidia’s “stealth entry” into Edge AI through its partnership with MediaTek, calling it a significant long-term opportunity, particularly in automotive and enterprise markets.

Tariff risks appear largely mitigated, according to the firm. “NVDA has in place a carefully crafted strategy to avoid nearly all tariffs,” Lynx said, noting recent exemptions from the U.S. Commerce Department and Nvidia’s diversified manufacturing footprint.

Lynx also pointed to “mega deals” such as the $500 billion Stargate project and new funding for AI clients like OpenAI and CoreWeave as likely to support future revenue growth.

“NVDA is on the verge of breaking out of the range and is headed for new highs,” Lynx concluded, maintaining a bullish stance into the earnings release.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/lynx-risk-priced-in-nvidia-could-surprise-to-the-upside-4065322
2025-05-27,09:15,SoundHound shares jump as Piper Sandler starts coverage at Overweight By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- Piper Sandler has initiated coverage on SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: ) with an Overweight rating and a $12 price target, describing the company as a “direct play on the A.I revolution” through its voice-AI platform.

The company’s shares jumped 5% in premarket trading Tuesday.

The broker’s analysts argue that SoundHound’s technology, particularly its combined ASR and NLP architecture, offers a competitive advantage in delivering dynamic, real-time conversational AI experiences.

SoundHound’s product suite spans across the auto, IoT, restaurant, and customer service sectors, with Piper Sandler identifying quick-service restaurants (QSRs) and customer experience (CX) as the company’s most promising verticals.

The acquisition of Amelia has enabled SoundHound to enter the conversational AI space for contact centers, which Piper Sandler sees as a $30 billion addressable market by 2027.

“Combined, we see a $30B serviceable addressable market by 2027, with SoundHound an early leader in each market,” analysts James E. Fish and Caden Dahl said in a Monday note.

They also see improving financial leverage as the company transitions to a subscription-based model. Subscription and “Over-Time” revenues are expected to comprise about 90% of total revenues by 2027, up from just 4% two years ago.

Piper believes this shift, along with anticipated synergies from the Amelia acquisition, will help drive margins higher. “At a minimum, we think synergies could boost margins by >10% over the next few years.”

Despite their bullishness for the long-term opportunity, SoundHound is not without its challenges, particularly in the auto segment where production headwinds persist.

Auto exposure is currently around 25% of global production, but SoundHound’s four key OEM clients are expected to see a 4% decline in sales this year.

“We are wary of other items such as auto production, low profitability but need for more awareness, and debate around organic growth, but see the opportunities and setup as more compelling at these levels,” the analysts concluded.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/soundhound-shares-jump-as-piper-sandler-starts-coverage-at-overweight-4065185
2025-05-27,08:32,25% tariff not enough to push Apple to reshore iPhone production,"Investing.com -- A 25% tariff on iPhones imported into the United States is unlikely to drive Apple (NASDAQ: ) to reshore its production, according to Morgan Stanley analysts.

“While ‘time to market’ of a U.S.-produced iPhone is one major impediment, our math says a 25% tariff on iPhone imports isn’t enough incentive for Apple to reshore U.S.-bound iPhone production,” the analysts wrote.

They estimate it would take “a minimum of 2+ years, and several billions” to build new iPhone assembly plants in the U.S.

President Trump reignited tariff concerns last week, threatening a 25% import tax on iPhones.

The move appeared to be a response to Apple’s continued shift of U.S.-bound iPhone assembly to India, away from China.

However, Morgan Stanley said the economics still favor overseas manufacturing. “A U.S.-produced iPhone would be 35% more expensive than a China/India-produced iPhone, much more than the 4-6% price hike needed to offset a 25% import tariff,” the note said.

The bank believes Apple’s defiance could come at a cost. “CEO Tim Cook’s status with the current administration deteriorates from here,” Morgan Stanley warned, adding that Apple now risks further tariff escalation. “Is a 50% tariff enough to shift production to the U.S.?” the bank asked.

The firm noted that it has already factored in 10-30% tariffs on all U.S.-bound imports beyond the June quarter and estimates the proposed 25% smartphone tariff would only reduce Apple’s FY26 EPS by about 11 cents.

Despite the pressure, Morgan Stanley believes Apple could neutralize the threat with further U.S. investment, as part of its previously announced $500 billion commitment.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/25-tariff-not-enough-to-push-apple-to-reshore-iphone-production--morgan-stanley-4064984
2025-05-27,08:23,JPM highlights top 6 European investment ideas for next 12–18 months By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- JPMorgan has laid out its top six investment ideas in Europe over the next 12 to 18 months, highlighting a range of sectors it expects to benefit from structural and policy-driven shifts.

First, the Wall Street giant’s strategists, led by Mislav Matejk,a maintain a bullish stance on European defense, citing “increased Defense spending, where European countries are set to shift from an average 2% Defense spending as a share of GDP towards 3.5% later this decade.”

While the group’s valuations appear stretched after strong recent gains, the strategists believe “earnings will deliver” and continue to view the sector as a structural buy.

The second opportunity is linked to Germany’s €500 billion infrastructure fund, which JPMorgan expects to support names across construction materials, industrials, and transportation.

The fund, set to be spent over 12 years, is seen as a key fiscal stimulus driver. Stocks in JPMorgan’s “Germany Whatever It Takes” basket are viewed as well-positioned to benefit from the rollout.

The basket includes stocks such as Siemens (ETR: ), UniCredit SpA (BIT: ), Rheinmetall (ETR: ), Vinci (EPA: ), Siemens Energy AG (ETR: ), and dozens of other stocks.

JPMorgan’s third idea centers on financials. While tactically cautious on banks due to falling rates, the bank sees medium-term upside driven by improving balance sheets, credit flow recovery, and declining cost of equity.

Insurance is also favored, with analysts staying Overweight on this subsector in the medium term, despite short-term valuation concerns.

The fourth theme focuses on beneficiaries of lower energy prices, especially in the chemicals sector. JPMorgan highlights that “chemicals are the only one of the EM-exposed Cyclicals which are starting to perform less poorly,” and reiterates its overweight stance made earlier this year.

Utilities and Telecoms make up the fifth category. JPMorgan sees opportunities in stocks offering high dividend yields, benefiting from higher grid spending and cash flow improvements.

“Our analysts are positive on RWE (LON: ), National Grid (LON: ), and Engie SA (EPA: ),” the note says, while Deutsche Telekom (ETR: ) and Orange SA (EPA: ) are highlighted within telecoms.

Finally, JPMorgan sees value in German small caps. The index has lagged large caps for several years, but the bank believes the underperformance could reverse as fiscal stimulus and industrial exposure provide support.

“MDAX appears attractively priced relative to and is underowned,” the strategists wrote.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/jpm-highlights-top-6-european-investment-ideas-for-next-1218-months-4064930
2025-05-27,08:05,"Next 300 points likely up for the S&P 500, says JPMorgan By Investing.com","Investing.com -- JPMorgan analysts see the next move for the as higher, despite the pullback in U.S. equities last week.

“The SPX fell 2.6% last week, trimming the MTD gain to 4.2% and pushing the YTD return back into negative territory, -1.3%,” JPMorgan said.

Despite this setback, the bank’s analysts argue the recent weakness represents a brief correction rather than a shift in direction.

“We had flagged pullback risk and believe that we experienced that last week,” JPMorgan said.

While the S&P 500 is still less than 6% below its all-time high, JPMorgan believes the “next 300 points” are more likely to be to the upside.

Their tactical bullish stance is based on three main drivers: “(i) stable macro data; (ii) positive earnings; and (iii) a further de-escalation of the trade war.”

Market volatility was elevated last week amid concerns about the U.S. fiscal outlook.

“While the 10Y yield only rose 3.4bps on the week, it traded in a 20bp range as the MOVE index increased 4.4%,“ JPMorgan wrote.

Meanwhile, international developed and emerging markets outperformed the U.S. last week, as the dollar continued to weaken, with the DXY falling another 2%.

JPMorgan highlighted that earnings from Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) could serve as a key catalyst, especially as the U.S.-EU trade dynamic experienced both escalation and de-escalation over the weekend.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/next-300-points-likely-up-for-the-sp-500-says-jpmorgan-4064865
2025-05-27,07:30,New surveys show declining interest in EVs and the Tesla brand around the world By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- Consumer interest in electric vehicles (EVs) and the Tesla (NASDAQ: ) brand is waning across key global markets, according to new survey data.

The latest UBS Evidence Lab Global EV Survey, which included over 10,000 respondents, shows a broad decline in Tesla’s standing as a preferred EV brand in the U.S., China, and Europe.

Globally, the share of consumers who would consider buying a Tesla has fallen to 36%, down from 39% last year. As a top battery electric vehicle (BEV) choice, Tesla slipped to 18% from 22%.

“The top choice decline was fairly prominent across the 3 major regions for Tesla,” UBS analysts led by Joseph Spak.

In the U.S., Tesla’s top choice share dropped sharply to 29% from 38%, despite maintaining a 48% share of the domestic BEV market. UBS attributes the slide to brand “saturation, a limited vehicle lineup, and affordability concerns.”

In China, Tesla fell to third place behind BYD (SZ: ) and Xiaomi Corp (HK: ), with top-choice preference down to 14% from 18%. Chinese consumers increasingly favor domestic brands, and Tesla is no longer viewed as the technology leader.

Moreover, Tesla’s top-choice ranking in Europe declined to 15% from 20%, with Audi and BMW (ETR: ) surpassing it in brand consideration.

Meanwhile, brokerage firm Stifel’s own survey shows that Tesla’s appeal is becoming more politically polarized in the U.S.

Net purchase consideration among Democrats dropped to -46% in May, from -30% in August 2024. Meanwhile, it improved among Republicans to -14% from -26%.

“The inflection point since August 2024 is likely due to numerous factors, but mainly Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s endorsement of President Trump and involvement in his Administration,” Stifel said.

“However, recent discussions of Elon Musk’s gradual scale back away from DOGE and political affiliations could lead to another inflection point in the data over the next few months,” it added.

Despite weaker sales volumes tied to shifting sentiment, Stifel’s team believes that progress on Full Self-Driving (FSD) and recent comments from Elon Musk about its rollout could be a more significant driver of Tesla shares in the coming quarters.

UBS’ data also raises questions about Tesla’s autonomous driving strategy. The bank found that only 12% of consumers globally are willing to pay more than $7,600 upfront for autonomous features, while just 18% would pay more than $100 per month. Tesla’s FSD product currently costs $8,000 upfront or $99 monthly.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/new-surveys-show-declining-interest-in-evs-and-the-tesla-brand-around-the-world-4064783
2025-05-27,07:03,StanChart sees Solana price rising over 50% by end of 2025 By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- Standard Chartered has begun coverage on (SOL) with a year-end 2025 price target of $275, implying a gain of more than 50% from current levels around $175.

While the bank acknowledges that Solana is likely to underperform over the next two to three years, it sees longer-term potential for the network once new sectors start to scale.

“Solana is a fast, cheap alternative to Ethereum; as a result, it has dominated memecoin trading,” said Geoff Kendrick, Global Head of Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered, said, citing the network’s superior transaction throughput and reliability.

However, he notes that memecoin activity is “being discounted to a quantifiable degree by markets,” which has contributed to Solana trading “cheap” relative to its achieved application revenue, or “GDP.”

Most of Solana’s current usage is concentrated in trading applications, particularly decentralized exchanges that facilitate high-volume, low-value memecoin transactions. While this has helped stress-test the network’s capabilities, Kendrick warns that the associated revenues may be unsustainable.

“Solana trades ‘cheap’ on our market cap-to-GDP metric,” the analyst said, attributing this to a “more aggressive discount factor” being applied to future earnings compared to other chains.

“Put another way, Solana’s recent high fees and high activity on the back of memecoin trading may be seen as unsustainable,” Kendrick explained.

Looking ahead, Standard Chartered sees potential for Solana to dominate in emerging sectors like decentralized social media, high-throughput financial applications, and infrastructure platforms, though it expects these use cases to take two to three years to scale.

“The key to Solana’s future success will be to take its core advantage in transaction confirmation (fast, cheap and reliable) and apply it to something other than memecoin trading,” Kendrick continued.

Beyond the near-term challenges, the analyst forecasts SOL at $310 by end-2026 and $500 by end-2029. Standard Chartered’s year-end target for 2025 is $275.",https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/stanchart-sees-solana-price-rising-over-50-by-end-of-2025-4064655
2025-05-27,06:47,Temu owner PDD Holdings shares fall sharply on big Q1 results miss By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- Temu owner PDD Holdings Inc DRC (NASDAQ: ) saw its shares tumble more than 18% after reporting notably worse-than-expected earnings and revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2025.

The Chinese online retailer posted Q1 earnings per share (EPS) of RMB11.41, falling well short of analyst expectations of RMB19.44.

Revenue for the period rose 10% year-over-year, RMB95.67 billion, but still missed the consensus forecast of RMB102.98 billion.

“In the first quarter, we made substantial investments in our platform ecosystem to support merchants and consumers amid rapid changes in the external environment,” said Mr. Lei Chen, Chairman and Co-CEO of PDD Holdings.

“These investments weighed on short-term profitability but gave merchants the room to adapt and focus on high-quality, sustainable growth, strengthening the long-term health of the platform,"" he added.

PDD’s revenue from online marketing services (OMS) and others came in at RMB48.72 billion, slightly ahead of the RMB47.99 billion estimate.

Meanwhile, transaction services revenue disappointed at RMB46.95 billion, short of the projected RMB54.23 billion.

2025-05-27,06:26,Citi sees up to 8% downside for Stoxx 600 on Trump tariff risk By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- Citi analysts warned in a note Tuesday that European equities could face significant downside if President Trump’s tariff threats materialize.

The bank outlined the potential implications of a 50% tariff on European goods, a scenario the firm is treating as hypothetical for now but one that has already rattled markets.

While Trump said on Sunday that he has agreed to delay the 50% tariff on the European Union until July 9, Citi noted that the “surprise announcement on a possible 50% tariff on European goods” had triggered broad selling in European equities.

The Index could drop “c7-8% from here” if the tariff threats are enacted and priced in, according to Citi’s projections.

Earnings estimates for European companies have already started to reflect increased geopolitical risks.

“Analyst consensus forecasts for 2025E European EPS growth have fallen from +7% pre-Liberation day to c2% now,” Citi noted. That decline is said to be consistent with their prior modeling of the earnings impact from a 20% tariff.

However, should tariffs rise to 50%, Citi’s top-down models suggest EPS growth could deteriorate further.

“EPS growth could fall another 5-6% to c-4%, if 50% broad tariffs are implemented,” they warned. “This comes against the backdrop of the market pricing in c4% EPS growth over the next 12m.”

Citi emphasized that the uncertainty surrounding trade policy is already dragging down sentiment and could translate into more pronounced equity declines if the threats are realized.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/citi-sees-up-to-8-downside-for-stoxx-600-on-trump-tariff-risk-4064531
2025-05-27,04:55,What could be the impact of a 50% tariff on EU economy? By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat to impose a 50% tariff on imports from the European Union could significantly undermine eurozone growth and raise the risk of a broader trade conflict, according to UBS.

While the initial move was delayed until July 9 following talks with European Commission (EC) President Ursula von der Leyen, UBS warns that this is not a “stable equilibrium” and that the risk of escalation remains elevated.

UBS had previously estimated that the 20% reciprocal tariffs announced in April would push the eurozone into a technical recession in the second half of 2025, reducing growth by 0.7 percentage points.

In the case of a 50% tariff, the impact could be even deeper. “A 50% tariff—if maintained—would roughly imply a doubling of the effective tariff rate announced on April 2,” UBS economists led by Felix Huefner wrote.

They estimate eurozone GDP growth could fall from the current forecast of 0.7% in 2025 and 1% in 2026 to just 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively.

In the near term, companies may front-load shipments to the U.S. ahead of the July deadline, potentially boosting second-quarter activity. However, the economists note this would likely be followed by weaker performance later in the year.

The tariff shock so far has been disinflationary, but that could reverse if the EU retaliates. “Should the EC implement retaliation measures, inflation pressures could increase, everything else being equal.”

Brussels has already prepared two retaliation packages: a €21 billion list of tariffs delayed until July 14, and a broader €95 billion proposal under public consultation. Should negotiations with the U.S. collapse, UBS expects the EU to respond, viewing the current blanket and sectoral tariffs as “probably unacceptable” to the Commission.

“Overall then, this could potentially lead to a further escalation in trade tensions with the U.S.,” the economists added.

While fiscal spending on infrastructure and defense may support growth starting in 2026, UBS sees the coming months as pivotal.

The bank warns that recent developments increase the risk that U.S. tariffs may remain elevated after mid-July, undermining hopes for a rollback and threatening growth, while also heightening the chance of EU retaliation that could trigger a tit-for-tat escalation with negative impacts on both growth and inflation.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/what-could-be-the-impact-of-a-50tariff-on-eu-economy-4064349
2025-05-27,03:20,"Higher U.S. futures, new Nvidia chip, falling Tesla sales","Investing.com - U.S. stock futures gained strongly Tuesday as U.S. President Donald Trump postponed the imposition of tariffs on EU imports, potentially leaving room for negotiations to avoid a costly trade war. Elsewhere, Nvidia is working on a new chip for the Chinese market, Tesla’s sales slumped in Europe in April and bitcoin slipped from record highs ahead of a key conference.

1. U.S. futures surge on EU tariffs postponement

U.S. stock futures surged Tuesday, responding to the news that President Trump has agreed to postpone imposing tariffs on imports from the European Union, raising hope that a potentially costly trade battle can be averted.

At 03:10 ET (07:10 GMT), the traded 70 points, or 1.2%, higher gained 290 points, or 1.4%, and rose 435 points, or 1.1%.

Wall Street was closed on Monday in recognition of Memorial Day, and the major indices all slid more than 2% on Friday after Trump proposed a 50% tariff on EU imports starting June 1, citing ongoing frustrations with trade negotiations.

However, by Sunday, Trump indicated a shift in stance, stating that he had agreed to postpone the tariffs until July 9 after a conversation with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

Von der Leyen, in a post on X, expressed optimism, stating that the EU is prepared to move forward with negotiations “swiftly and decisively.”

The U.S. president’s latest U-turn on EU tariffs reinforces how unpredictable his trade policies can be and undermines already fragile investor confidence in the U.S. economy.

With this in mind, investors are likely Tuesday to carefully study commentary from Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari and New York Fed President John Williams, adding to a series of comments from their colleagues last week.

“A number of Fed speakers took to the airwaves. The message is tariffs are likely to create risks on both sides of the Fed’s mandate. The right response is to wait,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote, summing up the consensus ahead of the June FOMC meeting.

2. Nvidia plans to launch new AI chip in China - Reuters

Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) plans to launch, potentially as early as June, a new artificial intelligence chip in China at a lower price than its recently restricted H20 chip, according to a report from Reuters.

The proposed chip will have weaker specifications and simpler manufacturing requirements, and will use conventional GDDR7 memory instead of the high bandwidth memory used by more advanced AI chips.

The push for a new China chip comes as Nvidia struggles against new U.S. export restrictions to remain competitive in the Chinese market.

Nvidia has been steadily losing market share in China since 2022, dropping to 50% from 95%, but CEO Jensen Huang recently said China remained a valuable market for Nvidia, and could balloon to a $50 billion sales market in the coming years.

Nvidia faces stiff competition from China’s Huawei, which has made steady advancements in its AI chip development capabilities in recent years.

3. Tesla sales continue to plunge in Europe

Electric vehicle market leader Tesla’s (NASDAQ: ) sales in Europe continued to slump last month, dropping by nearly a half from last year, government data showed earlier Tuesday.

Tesla’s new car registrations in the European Union, the European Free Trade Association, and the U.K., slid 49% year-on-year to 7,261 units in April from 14,228 units a year ago, data from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association showed.

Tesla’s market share also nearly halved to 0.7% from 1.3% a year ago.

The drop came even as overall battery EV sales continued to expand in Europe, growing 34.1% year-on-year to 145,341 new registrations in April.

Overall European new car registrations shrank marginally to 1.07 million units from 1.08 million units.

Tesla is struggling with increased competition for an aging lineup from several established European automakers, who have also begun offering their own EVs. Chinese EV exports to Europe have also picked up in recent months, despite increased import tariffs on the sector.

A persistent decline in European sales also indicated that a Tesla boycott, centered around CEO Elon Musk and his political affiliations, showed little signs of easing in the region.

4. Bitcoin slips from highs ahead of key conference

slipped Tuesday from last week’s record high, as investors turned their focus to the start of the major 2025 Bitcoin conference in Las Vegas later in the session.

At 03:10 ET, the world’s largest cryptocurrency fell 0.9% to $109,050.

The token surged to a record high of nearly $112,000 on Thursday last week, amid regulatory cheer and optimism over increased institutional adoption.

Markets now await the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, beginning later Tuesday at the Venetian Expo in Las Vegas.

This year’s edition is expected to be the largest to date, drawing over 30,000 attendees, featuring more than 400 speakers, and involving 5,000 participating companies.

5. Crude stable ahead of OPEC+ meeting

Oil prices steadied Tuesday, as investors stayed on the sidelines ahead of a closely watched OPEC+ meeting that could provide key signals on future supply levels.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency added 0.1% to $109,710.0 as of 09:53 ET (13:53 GMT).

The token surged to a record high of nearly $112,000 on Thursday last week, but gave some of the gains amid profit-booking and whale trades at peak levels.

Bitcoin near record high; markets await 2025 crypto conference

Bitcoin surged to a record high last week as both the U.S. and Hong Kong advanced significant regulatory initiatives aimed at establishing comprehensive frameworks for stablecoins.

In the U.S., the Senate advanced the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act. Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s legislature passed a landmark stablecoin bill, introducing a licensing framework for fiat-referenced stablecoin issuers.

Investors also saw a shift in Wall Street’s view, where reports emerged that major U.S. banks were considering launching a joint stablecoin venture.

Markets now await the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, beginning on May 27 at the Venetian Expo in Las Vegas.

This year’s edition is expected to be the largest to date, drawing over 30,000 attendees, featuring more than 400 speakers, and involving 5,000 participating companies.

Notable speakers at the event include Michael Saylor, Justin Sun, Jack Mallers, and Robinhood (NASDAQ: ) CEO Vlad Tenev.

U.S. Vice President JD Vance, Senator Cynthia Lummis, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, and economist Peter Schiff are also scheduled to appear.

Trump Media to raise $2.5bn for Bitcoin treasury, shares sink

Trump Media & Technology Group said Tuesday that it has reached agreements with institutional investors to raise approximately $2.5 billion, with plans to use the funds to establish a Bitcoin treasury.

Shares of the Truth Social operator fell around 7% following the market open on Tuesday.

The news comes after Trump Media denied a Financial Times report that it plans to raise $3 billion to invest in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, calling the story writers ""dumb"" and the sources unreliable.

TMTG, the media company backed by the Trump family and parent of Truth Social, is seeking $2 billion in equity and $1 billion through a convertible bond to finance large-scale crypto purchases, the FT reported on Monday, citing six people familiar with the matter.

The FT report sent Trump Media shares soaring roughly 11% in premarket trading Tuesday, before reversing all of the gains.

2025-05-27,01:40,"Gold prices sink as Trump EU tariff delay spurs some risk, yields retreat By Investing.com","Investing.com-- Gold prices fell in Asian trade on Tuesday, extending recent declines after U.S. President Donald Trump’s postponement of steep trade tariffs on Europe helped buoy risk appetite.

The yellow metal was also pressured by some signs of stability in the bond market, as major government bond yields retreated in Asian trade after a sharp run-up in recent sessions.

Still, gold’s overall losses were limited by persistent weakness in the dollar. But broader metal prices also lost ground after strong gains through the past week.

Gold dips as Trump tariff turnaround spurs risk

Gold was pressured chiefly by some improving risk appetite after Trump delayed plans to immediately impose 50% tariffs on the European Union.

Trump said the tariffs will kick-in by early-July, when the rest of his planned reciprocal tariffs are also set to take effect.

The move offered some relief to markets fearing a worsening in global trade conditions, and sparked buying into risk-driven assets. U.S. stock index futures rose sharply on Tuesday, although volumes were dulled by a U.S. holiday on Monday.

But despite this week’s losses, gold still remained relatively underpinned by concerns over the long-term impact of Trump’s tariffs.

Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari warned on Monday that the tariffs were likely to spur a stagflationary shock for the U.S. economy, ie– an era of sluggish growth and high inflation.

But he also said that the Fed was unlikely to cut rates in the near-term, helping spur some buying in battered U.S. Treasuries.

Metal prices sink as Treasuries, bond yields stabilize

Broader metal prices fell on Tuesday, amid some buying into government bonds after a sharp selldown in the sector over the past week.

A Moody’s downgrade to the U.S. sovereign rating, coupled with the progress of a divisive tax cut bill in Congress, sparked heightened concerns over high government debt levels.

These concerns sparked an extended selldown in Treasuries, sending yields up sharply. But yields were seen coming down from recent peaks on Tuesday, while the dollar steadied, pressuring metal prices.

2025-05-27,00:58,"BYD shares slide further from record highs amid price cuts, competition concerns By Investing.com","Investing.com-- BYD’s Hong Kong listed shares slid further from record highs on Tuesday, after the electric vehicle maker’s recent price cuts sparked increased concerns over higher competition and shrinking margins in the Chinese market.

BYD (HK: ) fell 3.6% to HK$409.80, and was among the top weights on the index, which shed 0.2%.

BYD rivals Xpeng (NYSE: ) Inc (HK: ), NIO Inc (HK: ), Li Auto Inc (HK: ), and Zhejiang Leapmotor Technology Co Ltd (HK: ) fell between 1.7% and 3% in HK trade, also extending recent losses. Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd (HK: ) fell 3.2%.

Weakness in Chinese EV stocks was driven by BYD and some of its rivals announcing more price cuts and incentives over the past week, sparking concerns over a worsening price war in China’s EV market.

Price cuts and freebies also herald more margin pressure for BYD, which could dampen the company’s otherwise strong earnings. While investors had welcomed BYD’s recent move to offer driver assistance technology for free across several low-cost models, they questioned just how much earnings pressure such a move could herald.

BYD’s shares were also subject to profit-taking after they rushed to record highs last week, on optimism over the company’s overseas expansion. A recent report showed BYD’s EV sales overtook rival Tesla (NASDAQ: ) for the first time in Europe in April– a major milestone for the company, after it also overtook Tesla in China last year.

Tesla’s new car registrations in the European Union, the European Free Trade Association, and the UK, slid 49% year-on-year to 7,261 units in April from 14,228 units a year ago, data from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association ( ACEA (BIT: )) showed.

Tesla’s market share also nearly halved to 0.7% from 1.3% a year ago.

The drop came even as overall battery EV sales continued to expand in Europe, growing 34.1% y-o-y to 145,341 new registrations in April. Overall European new car registrations shrank marginally to 1.07 million units from 1.08 million units.

Tesla is struggling with increased competition for an aging lineup from several established European automakers, who have also begun offering their own EVs. Chinese EV exports to Europe have also picked up in recent months, despite increased import tariffs on the sector.

A recent report showed China’s BYD (SZ: ) overtook Tesla in EV sales in Europe for the first time in April.

Tesla is moving to update several of its popular models- chiefly the best-selling Model Y– to keep up with increased competition from China. EV sales were also seen petering off in recent years as cost conscious customers moved towards hybrids as a more practical alternative.

A persistent decline in European sales also indicated that a Tesla boycott, centered around CEO Elon Musk and his political affiliations, showed little signs of easing in the region. Ire over Musk had sparked protests at several Tesla facilities in Europe and the U.S., and had also sparked instances of vandalism and arson.

Musk had said recently that Tesla’s sales were recovering in regions outside Europe.

2025-05-26,22:48,Asia stocks muted amid trade caution; Japan recovers on yen weakness By Investing.com,"Updates with turnaround in Japan shares

Investing.com-- Most Asian stocks moved in a flat-to-low range on Tuesday as investors remained on edge over more U.S. trade tariffs, while Japanese markets recovered from early losses as weakness in the yen offset chatter over more interest rate hikes by the Bank of Japan.

Regional markets received scant trading cues from Wall Street, which was closed on Monday for the Memorial Day holiday. But U.S. stock index futures rose sharply in Asian trade, as investors cheered President Donald Trump’s delaying of steep trade tariffs on the European Union.

Japan shares recover as improving risk dents yen; Ueda talks rate hikes

Japan’s rose 0.5%, while the added 0.4% by the market close. Both indexes reversed initial losses and were headed for a stronger close.

Gains were biased towards export-oriented sectors, which benefited from some weakening in the yen after Reuters reported that the Japanese government was considering trimming some long-term bond issuances, amid recent turmoil in sovereign debt markets.

The yen was also under some pressure from improving risk appetite, after Trump’s tariff delay.

Still, the Japanese currency had firmed earlier on Tuesday, while stocks had fallen after BOJ Governor Ueda flagged risks from high underlying inflation, and warned that the central bank will raise interest rates further if the Japanese economy improves.

Ueda said that if upcoming economic readings continue to signal strength, the BOJ will further scale back monetary easing. He also said that Japanese inflation was the closest it has been to the BOJ’s 2% annual target in 30 years.

Ueda’s comments come after data last week showed a bigger-than-expected pickup in Japanese consumer inflation, as private spending was supported by strong springtime wage hikes.

But Japan’s economy shrank in the first quarter of 2025, amid growing concerns over the impact of U.S. trade tariffs on local businesses, especially automakers.

Asia stocks muted amid tariff caution

Broader Asian markets moved in a flat-to-low range on Tuesday, as investors remained on edge over more U.S. trade tariffs. While Trump did postpone his proposed EU tariffs, he did not address his threat to tariff smartphone imports to the U.S., which could bode poorly for several Asian tech majors.

South Korea’s was among the worst performers in Asia on Tuesday, down 0.5% as chipmakers Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS: ) and SK Hynix Inc (KS: ) retreated. Samsung could also be subject to U.S. import duties on smartphones.

Trump’s smartphone tariff threat was aimed primarily at Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ), which sent shares of the company’s Asian suppliers lower this week. Hong Kong and China-listed AAC Technologies (OTC: ) (HK: ) and Luxshare Precision Industry Co Ltd (SZ: ) lost nearly 2% each. Xiaomi Corp (HK: ) lost 0.7% before its quarterly earnings due later in the day.

Taiwan’s TSMC (TW: ) fell 1%, while Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (TW: ) rose 0.3%.

HK-listed shares of JD.com (HK: ) fell sharply after rival Meituan’s (HK: ) CEO Wang Xing flagged heightened competition in China’s instant retail market.

Singapore’s index was flat, while Australia’s rose 0.5%, buoyed by some strength in financials.

2025-05-26,19:58,S&P 500 surges as consumer confidence rebounds. Trump delays EU tariff hike By Investing.com,"Investing.com-- U.S. stocks rose sharply Tuesday after U.S. consumer confidence rebounded following a five-month slump, cooling fears about the economy just days after President President Donald Trump postponed plans to impose steep trade tariffs on the European Union.

At 12:57 p.m. ET (16:57 GMT), the rose 641 points, or 1.5%, the index gained 1.8%, and the advanced 2.3%.

Wall Street was closed on Monday on account of the Memorial Day holiday.

Consumer confidence jumps by the most in four years

Consumer confidence saw a strong rebound in May, ending a five-month decline, largely driven by renewed optimism surrounding economic conditions and boosted further by the U.S.-China trade deal announced mid-month.

According to The Conference Board, the Consumer Confidence Index surged 12.3 points to 98.0, surpassing expectations of just 87.1. The sharp rise was fueled by improvements in both consumers’ short-term outlook—reflected in the Expectations Index jumping 17.4 points to 72.8—and perceptions of current conditions, with the Present Situation Index up 4.8 points to 135.9.

Senior Economist Stephanie Guichard noted that confidence was already improving ahead of the trade deal but accelerated in its aftermath, highlighting the deal’s positive impact on consumer sentiment.

Tech rallies as Nvidia (NASDAQ: )’s earnings loom large; Tesla (NASDAQ: ), Coreweave jump

Big tech stocks led market higher, with Nvidia rising more than 3% ahead of its quarterly results due Wednesday after the market closes.

The company is considered a bellwether for global AI demand, especially in the chipmaking sector, and is sitting on a massive valuation spike over the past two years on this position.

Nvidia is expected to report bumper earnings, especially as Wall Street’s so-called AI Hyperscalers– its biggest customers– continued to spend heavily on AI over the past three months.

Elsewhere, Southwest Airlines (NYSE: ) stock rose after the carrier announced it will charge customers $35 for one checked bag and $45 for the second, bringing an end to its free luggage policy.

Salesforce (NYSE: ) stock gained after the Wall Street Journal reported that the software company is nearing an agreement to acquire Informatica in a deal valued at approximately $8 billion.

The quarterly earnings season is largely at an end, with more than 95% of companies having already reported, with almost 78% having surpassed analyst expectations, according to FactSet.

Numbers from IT service management company Okta (NASDAQ: ) are due after the bell Tuesday.

Elsewhere, Tesla climbed more than 6% after CEO Elon Musk said he would be ""super focused on /xAI and Tesla (plus Starship launch next week), as we have critical technologies rolling out.”

The remarks helped further restore confidence in Musk’s leadership amid concerns that his role within the Trump administration was taking too much of his focus.

CoreWeave Inc (NASDAQ: ) rose more than 15%, shrugging off a downgrade from Barclays to equalweight, citing concerns about limited short-term upside given the stock’s post-IPO run up.

Trump postpones 50% EU tariffs to July

Sentiment received a boost after Trump stated late Sunday that he had agreed to postpone his recently proposed 50% tariffs on goods from the EU to July 9, following a call with EU President Ursula von der Leyen.

Trump also said that his administration will begin trade talks in earnest with the EU, while Von Der Leyen also flagged improving relations with Washington.

The development offered some relief to markets, which were rattled on Friday by Trump threatening steep tariffs on the EU, along with Apple (NASDAQ: ).

This resulted in a losing week on Wall Street, with all three major indices falling more than 2% over the course of last week.

The July 9 deadline is also around when Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs are set to take effect, and the market’s remain focused on whether major U.S. trading partners can clinch agreements with Washington before the deadline.

More Fed speeches due

The U.S. president’s latest U-turn on EU tariffs reinforces how unpredictable his trade policies can be and undermines already fragile investor confidence in the U.S. economy.

An illustration of this uncertainty came with the orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods, which slumped in April, falling after the previous month’s sharp gains.

Orders for –items designed to last three years or more–fell 6.3% last month after a hefty revised 7.6% gain in March, the Commerce Department’s Census Bureau said on Tuesday.

Transportation equipment, down following four consecutive monthly increases, drove the decrease, falling $20.3 billion or 17.1 percent to $98.8 billion.

Minneapolis Federal Reserve President on Tuesday continued to call for a pause rates until there was more uncertainty on the tariff impact.

Investors are also likely Tuesday to carefully study commentary from Fed Governor Christopher Waller and New York Fed President and adding to a series of comments from their colleagues last week.

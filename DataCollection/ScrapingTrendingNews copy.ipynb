                  "Investing.com-- A federal judge said on Tuesday that a lawsuit brought by 14 U.S. states challenging the legality of Elon Musk’s role in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under President Donald Trump may proceed.\n\nThe suit alleges that Tesla (NASDAQ: ) CEO Musk, classified as a “special Government employee,” functioned as a de facto principal officer of DOGE, an agency created by executive order without congressional authorization, and wielded sweeping authority over federal spending, personnel, and regulations.\n\nThe plaintiffs claimed Musk and DOGE unilaterally dismantled agencies, terminated federal contracts, and accessed sensitive systems in violation of the Constitution’s Appointments Clause, the judge stated in a court filing.\n\nIn a 42-page opinion, Judge Tanya S. Chutkan denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss the case against Musk and DOGE, allowing the states’ ultra vires claims to move forward. The court found the DOGE entity lacked a statutory or constitutional basis and that Musk’s alleged conduct exceeded lawful bounds.\n\nHowever, the court dismissed claims against Trump in his official capacity, citing established precedent barring courts from enjoining the president’s discretionary duties.",

The company is offering 9.6 million class A shares, while selling shareholders are offering 14.4 million shares, priced at $24 to $26. .\n\nThe company has received orders for multiple times the shares available, Bloomberg reported, citing a person familiar with the matter.\n\nCircle’s IPO represents the company’s second attempt to publicly list, after a $9 billion blank-check deal with a special purpose acquisition vehicle fell through in 2022.\n\nBut the company returns to public markets amid improving sentiment towards crypto, especially amid persistent vows of friendlier policy from President Donald Trump.\n\nCircle’s IPO also comes as a stablecoin bill– the GENIUS act– progresses towards passage through Congress. The bill is aimed at establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins in the United States.\n\n, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, hit a record high last week on optimism over friendlier regulation.

                  "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures rose slightly on Tuesday evening with focus squarely on earnings from artificial intelligence major Nvidia, with sentiment upbeat on some trade tariff deescalation and positive consumer data.\n\nFutures steadied after a stellar session on Wall Street, as investors cheered President Donald Trump’s delaying of steep trade tariffs against the European Union, while stronger-than-expected consumer confidence data pointed to resilience in the economy.\n\nTechnology stocks also courted heavy buying before Nvidia’s earnings, which are likely to act as a bellwether for the sector. Analysts expect another strong quarter from the chipmaker.\n\nrose 0.1% to 5,939.75 points, while rose 0.1% to 21,476.75 points by 19:14 ET (23:14 GMT) rose 0.1% to 42,465.0 points.\n\nNvidia Q1 earnings awaited for more AI cues; shares surge\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: ) is set to report its first-quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday, with analysts expecting a strong print.\n\nShares of the AI major surged 3.2% on Tuesday and were flat in after-hours trade.\n\nNvidia is forecast to post earnings per share of $0.893 on revenue of $43.12 billion for the three months to April 31, both up substantially from last year, Investing.com data showed.\n\nThe chipmaker is expected to have benefited from outsized domestic demand, especially as its biggest customers– Wall Street’s so-called AI hyperscalers– continued spending billions on building more data center capacity.\n\nBut focus will be on Nvidia’s outlook, which is likely to set the tone for the tech industry going forward in 2025. Investors will also be watching for comments on Nvidia’s China sales, as the company grapples with more U.S. export controls and increased competition in the country.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang recently criticized the U.S. export restrictions, calling them a \"failure,\" and also forecast China becoming a $50 billion market in the coming years.\n\nWall St rises on Trump tariff delay, strong consumer sentiment\n\nWall Street clocked strong gains on Tuesday, after Trump’s delaying of 50% tariffs against the EU boosted risk appetite. Trump’s move– which is another instance of the president flip-flopping on his tariff plans– spurred bets that he will not deliver on his agenda of imposing steep reciprocal trade tariffs in July.\n\nSentiment was also boosted by substantially stronger than expected data for May, which rebounded after five months of declines.\n\nThe rebound also comes following a deescalation in trade tensions between the U.S. and China, and as Trump’s administration attempts to reach trade deals with several major economies.\n\nThe rose 2.1% to 5,921.54 points, while the surged 2.5% to 19,199.16 points on Tuesday.
